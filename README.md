# Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa)* begins with the definition of the ultimate source. It is a bona fide commentary on the *Vedanta-sutra* by the same author, Srila Vyasadeva, and gradually it develops into nine cantos up to the highest state of God realization.

## Srila Prabhupada

At various times people have called him a scholar, a philosopher, a cultural ambassador, a prolific author, a religious leader, a spiritual teacher, a social critic, and a holy man. In truth, he was all these things and more.

Srila Prabhupada set out to America in 1965 and established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness at the age of sixty-nine. He travelled around the world fourteen times, established more than 100 temples of Krishna and initiated more than 10000 disciples into Krishna consciousness.

A brief biography of his divine presence in this material world can be found out [here](https://krishna.org/srila-prabhupada-a-brief-biography/).
