<h1><a class="header" href="#the-history-of-the-life-of-ajamila" id="the-history-of-the-life-of-ajamila">The History of the Life of Ajamila</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#61" id="61">6.1</a></strong></p>
<p>Throughout Srimad-Bhagavatam there are descriptions of ten subject matters, including creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami, the speaker of Srimad-Bhagavatam, has already described creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cantos.</p>
<p>Now, in this Sixth Canto, which consists of nineteen chapters, he will describe posana, or protection by the Lord.</p>
<p>The first chapter relates the history of Ajamila, who was considered a greatly sinful man, but was liberated when four order carriers of Visnu came to rescue him from the hands of the order carriers of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>A full description of how he was liberated, having been relieved of the reactions of his sinful life, is given in this chapter.</p>
<p>Sinful activities are painful both in this life and in the next.</p>
<p>We should know for certain that the cause of all painful life is sinful action.</p>
<p>On the path of fruitive work one certainly commits sinful activities, and therefore according to the considerations of karma-kanda, different types of atonement are recommended.</p>
<p>Such methods of atonement, however, do not free one from ignorance, which is the root of sinful life.</p>
<p>Consequently one is prone to commit sinful activities even after atonement, which is therefore very inadequate for purification.</p>
<p>On the path of speculative knowledge one becomes free from sinful life by understanding things as they are.</p>
<p>Therefore the acquirement of speculative knowledge is also considered a method of atonement.</p>
<p>While performing fruitive activities one can become free from the actions of sinful life through austerity, penance, celibacy, control of the mind and senses, truthfulness and the practice of mystic yoga.</p>
<p>By awakening knowledge one may also neutralize sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Neither of these methods, however, can free one from the tendency to commit sinful activities.</p>
<p>By bhakti-yoga one can completely avoid the tendency for sinful life; other methods are not very feasible.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic literature concludes that devotional service is more important than the methods of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda.</p>
<p>Only the path of devotional service is auspicious for everyone.</p>
<p>Fruitive activities and speculative knowledge cannot independently liberate anyone, but devotional service, independent of karma and jnana, is so potent that one who has fixed his mind at the lotus feet of Krsna is guaranteed not to meet the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, even in dreams.</p>
<p>To prove the strength of devotional service, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of Ajamila.</p>
<p>Ajamila was a resident of Kanyakubja (the modern Kanauj).</p>
<p>He was trained by his parents to become a perfect brahmana by studying the Vedas and following the regulative principles, but because of his past, this youthful brahmana was somehow attracted by a prostitute, and because of her association he became most fallen and abandoned all regulative principles.</p>
<p>Ajamila begot in the womb of the prostitute ten sons, the last of whom was called Narayana.</p>
<p>At the time of Ajamila’s death, when the order carriers of Yamaraja came to take him, he loudly called the name Narayana in fear because he was attached to his youngest son.</p>
<p>Thus he remembered the original Narayana, Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Although he did not chant the holy name of Narayana completely offenselessly, it acted nevertheless.</p>
<p>As soon as he chanted the holy name of Narayana, the order carriers of Lord Visnu immediately appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>A discussion ensued between the order carriers of Lord Visnu and those of Yamaraja, and by hearing that discussion Ajamila was liberated.</p>
<p>He could then understand the bad effect of fruitive activities and could also understand how exalted is the process of devotional service.</p>

<p>sri-pariksid uvaca</p>
<p>nivrtti-margah kathita</p>
<p>adau bhagavata yatha</p>
<p>krama-yogopalabdhena</p>
<p>brahmana yad asamsrtih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-pariksit uvaca—Maharaja Pariksit said; nivrtti-margah—the path of liberation; kathitah—described; adau—in the beginning; bhagavata—by Your Holiness; yatha—duly; krama—gradually; yoga-upalabdhena—obtained by the yoga process; brahmana—along with Lord Brahma (after reaching Brahmaloka); yat—by which way; asamsrtih—cessation of the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit said: O my lord, O Sukadeva Gosvami, you have already described (in the Second Canto) the path of liberation (nivrtti-marga).</p>
<p>By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Thus one’s repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Maharaja Pariksit was a Vaisnava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned souls from the clutches of maya and take them back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore he reminded his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, about the nivrtti-marga, or path of liberation, which he had described in the Second Canto.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met Sukadeva Gosvami, inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation at that crucial time.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:</p>
<p>variyan esa te prasnah</p>
<p>krto loka-hitam nrpa</p>
<p>atmavit-sammatah pumsam</p>
<p>srotavyadisu yah parah</p>
<p>My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists (Bhag.2.1.1) Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Vancha-kalpa-tarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca: a Vaisnava is an ocean of mercy.</p>
<p>Para-duhkha-duhkhi: he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others.</p>
<p>Therefore Pariksit Maharaja, being compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that Sukadeva Gosvami continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The word asamsrti is very important in this connection.</p>
<p>Samsrti refers to continuing on the path of birth and death.</p>
<p>Asamsrti, on the contrary, refers to nivrtti-marga, or the path of liberation, by which one’s birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, was very eager to hear from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation for the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the acaryas, the word krama-yogopalabdhena indicates that by first performing karma-yoga and then jnana-yoga and finally coming to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one can be liberated.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga, however, is so powerful that it does not depend on karma-yoga or jnana-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in karma-yoga or an illiterate with no assets in jnana-yoga can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Mam evaisyasy asamsayah.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.7) that by the process of bhakti-yoga one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Yogis, however, instead of going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahma lives, as indicated here by the word brahmana.</p>
<p>At the time of dissolution, Lord Brahma, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Vedas as follows:</p>
<p>brahmana saha te sarve</p>
<p>samprapte pratisancare</p>
<p>parasyante krtatmanah</p>
<p>pravisanti param padam</p>
<p>Because of their exalted position, those who are on Brahmaloka at the time of dissolution go directly back home, back to Godhead, along with Lord Brahma</p>
