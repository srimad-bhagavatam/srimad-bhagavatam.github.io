<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#66" id="66">6.6</a></strong></p>
<p>As described in this chapter, Prajapati Daksa begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni.</p>
<p>These daughters were given in charity to various persons to increase the population.</p>
<p>Since these offspring of Daksa were women, Narada Muni did not try to lead them toward the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Thus the daughters were saved from Narada Muni.</p>
<p>Ten of the daughters were given in marriage to Dharmaraja, thirteen to Kasyapa Muni, and twenty-seven to the moon-god, Candra.</p>
<p>In this way fifty daughters were distributed, and of the other ten daughters, four were given to Kasyapa and two each to Bhuta, Angira and Krsasva.</p>
<p>One should know that it is because of the union of these sixty daughters with various exalted personalities that the entire universe was filled with various kinds of living entities, such as human beings, demigods, demons, beasts, birds and serpents.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; tatah—after that incident; pracetasah—Daksa; asiknyam—in his wife named Asikni; anunitah—pacified; svayambhuva—by Lord Brahma; sastim—sixty; sanjanayam asa—begot; duhitrh—daughters; pitr-vatsalah—all very affectionate to their father.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, thereafter, at the request of Lord Brahma, Prajapati Daksa, who is known as Pracetasa, begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni.</p>
<p>All the daughters were very affectionate toward their father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After the incidents concerning the loss of his many sons, Daksa repented his misunderstanding with Narada Muni.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma then saw Daksa and instructed him to beget children again.</p>
<p>This time Daksa was very cautious to beget female children instead of male children so that Narada Muni would not disturb them by urging them to accept the renounced order.</p>
<p>Females are not meant for the renounced order of life; they should be faithful to their good husbands, for if a husband is competent for liberation, his wife will also achieve liberation with him.</p>
<p>As stated in the sastra, the results of a husband’s pious activities are shared by his wife.</p>
<p>Therefore a woman’s duty is to be very chaste and faithful to her husband.</p>
<p>Then without separate endeavor she will share in all the profit the husband earns.</p>
