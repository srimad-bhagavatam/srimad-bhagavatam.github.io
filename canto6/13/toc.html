<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#613" id="613">6.13</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes Indra’s fear at having killed a brahmana (Vrtrasura), and it also describes how he fled and was saved by the grace of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vrtrasura, he refused because Vrtrasura was a brahmana.</p>
<p>The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the Narayana-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Even by a glimpse of the chanting of Narayana’s name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a brahmana.</p>
<p>The demigods advised Indra to perform an asvamedha sacrifice, by which Narayana would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.</p>
<p>Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vrtrasura, but when Vrtrasura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vrtrasura’s position.</p>
<p>This is the nature of a great personality.</p>
<p>Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally.</p>
<p>Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a brahmana.</p>
<p>Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins.</p>
<p>He went to Manasa-sarovara, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years.</p>
<p>During this time, Nahusa reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra’s wife, Sacidevi, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life.</p>
<p>Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted brahmanas and saints.</p>
<p>In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a brahmana.</p>
