<h1><a class="header" href="#king-citraketus-lamentation" id="king-citraketus-lamentation">King Citraketu’s Lamentation</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#614" id="614">6.14</a></strong></p>
<p>In this Fourteenth Chapter, Pariksit Maharaja asks his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, how such a demon as Vrtrasura could become an exalted devotee.</p>
<p>In this connection the previous life of Vrtrasura is discussed.</p>
<p>This involves the story of Citraketu and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the death of his son.</p>
<p>Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence.</p>
<p>Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination.</p>
<p>And among many millions of such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Therefore such devotees are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Since bhakti, devotional service, is not ordinary, Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that an asura could rise to the exalted position of a devotee.</p>
<p>Being doubtful, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami, who then described Vrtrasura with reference to his previous birth as Citraketu, the King of Surasena.</p>
<p>Citraketu, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage Angira.</p>
<p>When Angira inquired from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the great sage, the King’s first wife, Krtadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and lamentation.</p>
<p>Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy.</p>
<p>The co-wives of Krtadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child.</p>
<p>Citraketu was overwhelmed by shock at his son’s death.</p>
<p>Then Narada Muni and Angira went to see him.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-pariksit uvaca—King Pariksit inquired; rajah—of the mode of passion; tamah—and of the mode of ignorance; sva-bhavasya—having a nature; brahman—O learned brahmana; vrtrasya—of Vrtrasura; papmanah—who was supposedly sinful; narayane—in Lord Narayana; bhagavati—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; katham—how; asit—was there; drdha—very strong; matih—consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O learned brahmana, demons are generally sinful, being obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>How, then, could Vrtrasura have attained such exalted love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, everyone is obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>However, unless one conquers these modes and comes to the platform of goodness, there is no chance of one’s becoming a pure devotee.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Lord Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):</p>
<p>yesam tv anta-gatam papam</p>
<p>jananam punya-karmanam</p>
<p>te dvandva-moha-nirmukta</p>
<p>bhajante mam drdha-vratah</p>
<p>Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination Since Vrtrasura was among the demons, Maharaja Pariksit wondered how it was possible for him to have become such an exalted devotee.</p>
