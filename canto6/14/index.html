<h1>King Citraketu’s Lamentation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>6.14</strong></p>
<p>In this Fourteenth Chapter, Pariksit Maharaja asks his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, how such a demon as Vrtrasura could become an exalted devotee.</p>
<p>In this connection the previous life of Vrtrasura is discussed.</p>
<p>This involves the story of Citraketu and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the death of his son.</p>
<p>Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence.</p>
<p>Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination.</p>
<p>And among many millions of such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Therefore such devotees are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Since bhakti, devotional service, is not ordinary, Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that an asura could rise to the exalted position of a devotee.</p>
<p>Being doubtful, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami, who then described Vrtrasura with reference to his previous birth as Citraketu, the King of Surasena.</p>
<p>Citraketu, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage Angira.</p>
<p>When Angira inquired from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the great sage, the King’s first wife, Krtadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and lamentation.</p>
<p>Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy.</p>
<p>The co-wives of Krtadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child.</p>
<p>Citraketu was overwhelmed by shock at his son’s death.</p>
<p>Then Narada Muni and Angira went to see him.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-pariksit uvaca—King Pariksit inquired; rajah—of the mode of passion; tamah—and of the mode of ignorance; sva-bhavasya—having a nature; brahman—O learned brahmana; vrtrasya—of Vrtrasura; papmanah—who was supposedly sinful; narayane—in Lord Narayana; bhagavati—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; katham—how; asit—was there; drdha—very strong; matih—consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O learned brahmana, demons are generally sinful, being obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>How, then, could Vrtrasura have attained such exalted love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, everyone is obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>However, unless one conquers these modes and comes to the platform of goodness, there is no chance of one’s becoming a pure devotee.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Lord Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):</p>
<p>yesam tv anta-gatam papam</p>
<p>jananam punya-karmanam</p>
<p>te dvandva-moha-nirmukta</p>
<p>bhajante mam drdha-vratah</p>
<p>Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination Since Vrtrasura was among the demons, Maharaja Pariksit wondered how it was possible for him to have become such an exalted devotee.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.2</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this material world there are as many living entities as atoms.</p>
<p>Among these living entities, a very few are human beings, and among them, few are interested in following religious principles.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.4</strong></p>
<p>prayo mumuksavas tesam</p>
<p>kecanaiva dvijottama</p>
<p>mumuksunam sahasresu</p>
<p>kascin mucyeta sidhyati</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best of the brahmanas, Sukadeva Gosvami, out of many persons who follow religious principles, only a few desire liberation from the material world.</p>
<p>Among many thousands who desire liberation, one may actually achieve liberation, giving up material attachment to society, friendship, love, country, home, wife and children.</p>
<p>And among many thousands of such liberated persons, one who can understand the true meaning of liberation is very rare.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are four classes of men, namely karmis, jnanis, yogis and bhaktas.</p>
<p>This statement pertains especially to karmis and jnanis.</p>
<p>A karmi tries to he happy within this material world by changing from one body to another.</p>
<p>His objective is bodily comfort, either in this planet or in another.</p>
<p>When such a person becomes a jnani, however, be aspires for liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>Among many such persons who aspire for liberation, one may actually be liberated during his life.</p>
<p>Such a person gives up his attachment for society, friendship, love, country, family, wife and children.</p>
<p>Among many such persons, who are in the vanaprastha stage, one may understand the value of becoming a sannyasi, completely accepting the renounced order of life.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.5</strong></p>
<p>muktanam api siddhanam</p>
<p>narayana-parayanah</p>
<p>sudurlabhah prasantatma</p>
<p>kotisv api maha-mune</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>muktanam—of those who are liberated during this life (who are unattached to the bodily comforts of society, friendship and love); api—even; siddhanam—who are perfect (because they understand the insignificance of bodily comforts); narayana-parayanah—a person who has concluded that Narayana is the Supreme; su-durlabhah—very rarely found; prasanta—fully pacified; atma—whose mind; kotisu—out of millions and trillions; api—even; maha-mune—O great sage.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krsna.</p>
<p>Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the following purport to this verse.</p>
<p>Simply desiring mukti, or liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated.</p>
<p>When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the vanaprastha order, unattached to family, wife and children.</p>
<p>One should then further progress to the platform of sannyasa, the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life.</p>
<p>Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated.</p>
<p>Only rarely is someone liberated.</p>
<p>Indeed, although many men take sannyasa to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.</p>
<p>Jnanis, yogis and karmis devoid of devotional service are called offenders.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, mayavadi krsne aparadhi: one who thinks that everything is maya instead of thinking that everything is Krsna is called an aparadhi, or offender.</p>
<p>Although the Mayavadis, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Krsna, they may nonetheless be counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self.</p>
<p>They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is.</p>
<p>If such a person becomes narayana-parayana, a devotee of Lord Narayana, he is better than a jivan-mukta, one who is liberated or perfect.</p>
<p>This requires higher intelligence.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of jnanis.</p>
<p>One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal realization.</p>
<p>Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (sthula-tusavaghatinah).</p>
<p>The other class of jnanis, whose jnana is mixed with bhakti, are also of two kinds—those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), the actual spiritual form.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi devotees worship Narayana or Visnu with the idea that Visnu has accepted a form of maya and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal.</p>
<p>The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Visnu has accepted a body of maya; instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge.</p>
<p>He never merges in the Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.32):</p>
<p>ye ’nye ’ravindaksa vimukta-maninas</p>
<p>tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah</p>
<p>aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah</p>
<p>patanty adho ’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah</p>
<p>O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure.</p>
<p>Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet Evidence of this same point is also given in Bhagavad-gita (9.11), wherein the Lord says:</p>
<p>avajananti mam mudha</p>
<p>manusim tanum asritam</p>
<p>param bhavam ajananto</p>
<p>mama bhuta-mahesvaram</p>
<p>(Bg.9.11)</p>
<p>Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.</p>
<p>They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be When rascals (mudhas) see that Krsna acts exactly like a human being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the param bhavam, His transcendental form and activities.</p>
<p>Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-gita (9.12) as follows:</p>
<p>moghasa mogha-karmano</p>
<p>mogha-jnana vicetasah</p>
<p>raksasim asurim caiva</p>
<p>prakrtim mohinim sritah</p>
<p>Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views.</p>
<p>In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated Such persons do not know that Krsna’s body is not material.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between Krsna’s body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see Krsna as a human being, they deride Him.</p>
<p>They cannot imagine how a person like Krsna could be the origin of everything (govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami ).</p>
<p>Such persons are described as moghasah, baffled in their hopes.</p>
<p>Whatever they desire for the future will be baffled.</p>
<p>Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as moghasah because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p>Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated, because this is not the result of devotional service.</p>
<p>However, they are also given a chance to engage in devotional service and be purified.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):</p>
<p>srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah</p>
<p>punya-sravana-kirtanah</p>
<p>hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani</p>
<p>vidhunoti suhrt satam</p>
<p>Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma (Supersoul) in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted Unless the dirt within the core of one’s heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore the word sudurlabhah (very rarely foun) is used in this verse.</p>
<p>Not only among hundreds and thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found.</p>
<p>Therefore the words kotisv api are used herein.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya gives the following quotations from the Tantra Bhagavata:</p>
<p>nava-kotyas tu devanam</p>
<p>rsayah sapta-kotayah</p>
<p>narayanayanah sarve</p>
<p>ye kecit tat-parayanah</p>
<p>There are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called narayanayana, devotees of Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Among them, only a few are called narayana-parayana</p>
<p>narayanayana deva</p>
<p>rsy-adyas tat-parayanah</p>
<p>brahmadyah kecanaiva syuh</p>
<p>siddho yogya-sukham labhan</p>
<p>The difference between the siddhas and narayana-parayanas is that direct devotees are called narayana-parayanas whereas those who perform various types of mystic yoga are called siddhas.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.6</strong></p>
<p>vrtras tu sa katham papah</p>
<p>sarva-lokopatapanah</p>
<p>ittham drdha-matih krsna</p>
<p>asit sangrama ulbane</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vrtrah—Vrtrasura; tu—but; sah—he; katham—how; papah—although sinful (getting the body of a demon); sarva-loka—of all the three worlds; upatapanah—the cause of suffering; ittham—such; drdha-matih—firmly fixed intelligence; krsne—in Krsna; asit—there was; sangrame ulbane—in the great blazing fire of battle.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Vrtrasura was situated in the blazing fire of battle and was an infamous, sinful demon, always engaged in giving troubles and anxieties to others.</p>
<p>How could such a demon become so greatly Krsna conscious?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has been described that a narayana-parayana, a pure devotee, is rarely found even among millions and millions of persons.</p>
<p>Therefore Pariksit Maharaja was surprised that Vrtrasura, whose purpose was to give trouble and anxiety to others, was one of these devotees, even on a battlefield.</p>
<p>What was the reason for Vrtrasura’s advancement?</p>



<p><strong>6.14.7</strong></p>
<p>atra nah samsayo bhuyan</p>
<p>chrotum kautuhalam prabho</p>
<p>yah paurusena samare</p>
<p>sahasraksam atosayat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear lord, Sukadeva Gosvami, although Vrtrasura was a sinful demon, he showed the prowess of a most exalted ksatriya and satisfied Lord Indra in battle.</p>
<p>How could such a demon be a great devotee of Lord Krsna? These contradictions have caused me great doubt, and they have made me eager to hear of this from you.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.8</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Suta Gosvami said: After hearing Maharaja Pariksit’s very intelligent question, Sukadeva Gosvami, the most powerful sage, began answering his disciple with great affection.</p>

<p>Please listen with attention.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.10</strong></p>
<p>asid raja sarvabhaumah</p>
<p>surasenesu vai nrpa</p>
<p>citraketur iti khyato</p>
<p>yasyasit kamadhun mahi</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>asit—there was; raja—one king; sarva-bhaumah—an emperor of the entire surface of the globe; surasenesu—in the country known as Surasena; vai—indeed; nrpa—O King; citraketuh—Citraketu; iti—thus; khyatah—celebrated; yasya—of whom; asit—was; kama-dhuk—supplying all the necessities; mahi—the earth.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, in the province of Surasena there was a king named Citraketu, who ruled the entire earth.</p>
<p>During his reign, the earth produced all the necessities for life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the most significant statement is that the earth completely produced all the necessities of life during the time of King Citraketu.</p>
<p>As stated in the Isopanisad (Mantra1):</p>
<p>isavasyam idam sarvam</p>
<p>yat kinca jagatyam jagat</p>
<p>tena tyaktena bhunjitha</p>
<p>ma grdhah kasya svid dhanam</p>
<p>Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord.</p>
<p>One should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong Krsna, the supreme controller, has created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity.</p>
<p>The Lord supplies the necessities of all living entities.</p>
<p>These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of supply.</p>
<p>When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly.</p>
<p>However, when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity.</p>
<p>This is the significance of the word kamadhuk.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.10.4) it is said, kamam vavarsa parjanyah sarva-kama-dugha mahi: During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion We have experience that in some seasons the rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity.</p>
<p>We have no control over the earth’s productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>By His order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently.</p>
<p>If a pious king rules the earth according to the sastric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to provide for all men.</p>
<p>There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough.</p>
<p>Black-marketeering and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop.</p>
<p>Simply ruling the land cannot solve man’s problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities.</p>
<p>He must be like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Pariksit Maharaja or Ramacandra.</p>
<p>Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.11</strong></p>
<p>tasya bharya-sahasranam</p>
<p>sahasrani dasabhavan</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This Citraketu had ten million wives, but although he was capable of producing children, he did not receive a child from any of them.</p>
<p>By chance, all the wives were barren.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>rupa—with beauty; audarya—magnanimity; vayah—youth; janma—aristocratic birth; vidya—education; aisvarya—opulence; sriya-adibhih—wealth and so on; sampannasya—endowed; gunaih—with good qualities; sarvaih—all; cinta—anxiety; bandhya-pateh—of Citraketu, the husband of so many sterile wives; abhut—there was.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Citraketu, the husband of these millions of wives, was endowed with a beautiful form, magnanimity and youth.</p>
<p>He was born in a high family, he had a complete education, and he was wealthy and opulent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of being endowed with all these assets, he was full of anxiety because he did not have a son.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that the King first married one wife, but she could not bear a child.</p>
<p>Then he married a second, a third, a fourth and so on, but none of the wives could bear children.</p>
<p>In spite of the material assets of janmaisvarya-sruta-sri—birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and beauty—he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son.</p>
<p>Certainly his grief was natural.</p>
<p>Grhastha life does not mean having a wife and no children.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita says, putra-hinam grham sunyam: if a family man has no son, his home is no better than a desert.</p>
<p>The King was certainly most unhappy that he could not get a son, and this is why he had married so many times.</p>
<p>Ksatriyas especially are allowed to marry more than one wife, and this King did so.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he had no issue.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.13</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>His queens all had beautiful faces and attractive eyes, yet neither his opulences, his hundreds and thousands of queens, nor the lands of which he was the supreme proprietor were sources of happiness for him.</p>

<p><strong>6.14.17</strong></p>
<p>angira uvaca</p>
<p>api te ’namayam svasti</p>
<p>prakrtinam tathatmanah</p>
<p>yatha prakrtibhir guptah</p>
<p>puman raja ca saptabhih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>angirah uvaca—the great sage Angira said; api—whether; te—of you; anamayam—health; svasti—auspiciousness; prakrtinam—of your royal elements (associates and paraphernalia); tatha—as well as; atmanah—of your own body, mind and soul; yatha—like; prakrtibhih—by the elements of material nature; guptah—protected; puman—the living being; raja—the king; ca—also; saptabhih—by seven.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Angira said: My dear King, I hope that your body and mind and your royal associates and paraphernalia are well.</p>
<p>When the seven properties of material nature (the total material energy, the ego and the five objects of sense gratification) are in proper order, the living entity within the material elements is happy.</p>
<p>Without these seven elements one cannot exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, a king is always protected by seven elements—his instructor (svami or guru), his ministers, his kingdom, his fort, his treasury, his royal order and his friends.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As it is quoted by Sridhara Svami in his Bhagavatam commentary:</p>
<p>svamy-amatyau janapada</p>
<p>durga-dravina-sancayah</p>
<p>dando mitram ca tasyaitah</p>
<p>sapta-prakrtayo matah</p>
<p>A king is not alone.</p>
<p>He first has his spiritual master, the supreme guide.</p>
<p>Then come his ministers, his kingdom, his fortifications, his treasury, his system of law and order, and his friends or allies.</p>
<p>If these seven are properly maintained, the king is happy.</p>
<p>Similarly, as explained in Bhagavad-gita (dehino ’smin yatha dehe (Bg.2.13)), the living entity, the soul, is within the material covering of the mahat-tattva, ego and panca-tanmatra, the five objects of sense gratification.</p>
<p>When these seven are in proper order, the living entity is in a mood of pleasure.</p>
<p>Generally when the associates of the king are quiet and obedient, the king can be happy.</p>
<p>Therefore the great sage Angira Rsi inquired about the King’s personal health and the good fortune of his seven associates.</p>
<p>When we inquire from a friend whether everything is well, we are concerned not only with his personal self but also with his family, his source of income, and his assistants or servants.</p>
<p>All of them must be well, and then a person can be happy.</p>



<p><strong>6.14.18</strong></p>
<p>atmanam prakrtisv addha</p>
<p>nidhaya sreya apnuyat</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>atmanam—himself; prakrtisu—under these seven royal elements; addha—directly; nidhaya—placing; sreyah—ultimate happiness; apnuyat—may obtain; rajna—by the king; tatha—so also; prakrtayah—the dependent royal elements; nara-deva—O King; ahita-adhayah—offering wealth and other items.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, O lord of humanity, when a king directly depends upon his associates and follows their instructions, he is happy.</p>
<p>Similarly, when his associates offer their gifts and activities to the king and follow his orders, they are also happy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The actual happiness of a king and his dependents is described in this verse.</p>
<p>A king should not simply give orders to his dependents because he is supreme; sometimes he must follow their instructions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the dependents should depend on the king.</p>
<p>This mutual dependence will make everyone happy.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, are your wives, citizens, secretaries and servants and the merchants who sell spices and oil under your control? Are you also in full control of ministers, the inhabitants of your palace, your provincial governors, your sons and your other dependents?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The master or king and his subordinates should be interdependent.</p>
<p>Through cooperation, both of them can be happy.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If the king’s mind is fully controlled, all his family members and governmental officers are subordinate to him.</p>
<p>His provincial governors present taxes on time, without resistance, and what to speak of lesser servants?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Angira Rsi asked the King whether his mind was also under control.</p>
<p>This is most essential for happiness.</p>

<p>You seem not to have achieved your desired goal.</p>
<p>Is this because of you yourself, or has it been caused by others? Your pale face reflects your deep anxiety.</p>

<p>Thus King Citraketu, desiring a son, bent low in great humility and spoke to the great sage as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since the face is the index to the mind, a saintly person can study the condition of one’s mind by seeing his face.</p>
<p>When Angira Rsi remarked about the King’s discolored face, King Citraketu explained the cause of his anxiety as follows.</p>

<p>Therefore, as a perfect yogi, you can understand everything external and internal regarding embodied, conditioned souls like us.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Vedic civilization, one gets married simply to have a son, who is needed to offer oblations to his forefathers.</p>
<p>King Citraketu responsibly desired to beget a child so that he and his forefathers might be delivered from the darkest regions.</p>
<p>He was concerned with how to get pinda, oblations, in the next life, not only for himself but also for his forefathers.</p>
<p>Therefore he requested Angira Rsi to favor him by doing something that could help him get a son.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the great sage told the King, O great King, now you will have a son who will be the cause of both jubilation and lamentation The sage then left, without waiting for Citraketu’s response.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word harsa means jubilation and soka means lamentation The King was overwhelmed with joy when he understood that he would have a son.</p>
<p>Because of his great jubilation, he could not actually understand the statement of the sage Angira.</p>
<p>He accepted it to mean that there would certainly be jubilation because of the birth of his future son, but that he would be the King’s only son and, being very proud of his great wealth and empire, would not be very obedient to his father.</p>
<p>Thus the King was satisfied, thinking, Let there be a son.</p>
<p>It does not matter if he is not very obedient In Bengal there is a proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind.</p>
<p>The King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all.</p>
<p>The great sage Canakya Pandita says:</p>
<p>ko ’rthah putrena jatena</p>
<p>yo na vidvan na dharmikah</p>
<p>kanena caksusa kim va</p>
<p>caksuh pidaiva kevalam</p>
<p>What is the use of a son who is neither a learned scholar nor a devotee? Such a son is like a blind, diseased eye, which always causes suffering Nevertheless, the material world is so polluted that one wants to have a son even though he is useless.</p>
<p>This attitude was represented in the history of King Citraketu.</p>

<p>mata yasya grhe nasti</p>
<p>bharya capriya-vadini</p>
<p>aranyam tena gantavyam</p>
<p>yatharanyam tatha grham</p>
<p>A person who has no mother at home and whose wife does not speak sweetly should go to the forest.</p>
<p>For such a person, living at home and living in the forest are equal Similarly, for a woman who has no son, who is not cared for by her husband and whose co-wives neglect her, treating her like a maidservant, to go to the forest is better than to remain at home.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Alas, O Providence, O Creator, You are certainly inexperienced in creation, for during the lifetime of a father You have caused the death of his son, thus acting in opposition to Your creative laws.</p>
<p>If You are determined to contradict these laws, You are certainly the enemy of living entities and are never merciful.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the way a conditioned soul condemns the supreme creator when he meets reverses.</p>
<p>Sometimes he accuses the Supreme Personality of Godhead of being crooked because some people are happy and some are not.</p>
<p>Here the Queen blames supreme providence for her son’s death.</p>
<p>Following the creative laws, a father should die first and then his son.</p>
<p>If the creative laws are changed according to the whims of providence, then providence certainly should not be considered merciful, but must be considered inimical to the created being.</p>
<p>Actually it is not the creator, but the conditioned soul who is inexperienced.</p>
<p>He does not know how the subtle laws of fruitive activity work, and without knowledge of these laws of nature, he ignorantly criticizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; hi—indeed; kramah—chronological order; cet—if; iha—in this material world; mrtyu—of death; janmanoh—and of birth; saririnam—of the conditioned souls, who have accepted material bodies; astu—let it be; tat—that; atma-karmabhih—by the results of one’s karma (fruitive activities); yah—that which; sneha-pasah—bondage of affection; nija-sarga—Your own creation; vrddhaye—to increase; svayam—personally; krtah—made; te—by You; tam—that; imam—this; vivrscasi—you are cutting.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You may say that there is no law that a father must die in the lifetime of his son and that a son must be born in the lifetime of his father, since everyone lives and dies according to his own fruitive activity.</p>
<p>However, if fruitive activity is so strong that birth and death depend upon it, there is no need of a controller, or God.</p>
<p>Again, if You say that a controller is needed because the material energy does not have the power to act, one may answer that if the bonds of affection You have created are disturbed by fruitive action, no one will raise children with affection; instead, everyone will cruelly neglect his children.</p>
<p>Since You have cut the bonds of affection that compel a parent to raise his child, You appear inexperienced and unintelligent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Brahma-samhita, karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam: (Bs.5.54) one who has taken to Krsna consciousness, devotional service, is not affected by the results of karma.</p>
<p>In this verse, karma has been stressed on the basis of karma-mimamsa philosophy, which says that one must act according to his karma and that a supreme controller must give the results of karma.</p>
<p>The subtle laws of karma, which are controlled by the Supreme, cannot be understood by ordinary conditioned souls.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says that one who can understand Him and how He is acting, controlling everything by subtle laws, immediately becomes freed by His grace.</p>
<p>That is the statement of Brahma-samhita (karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam (Bs.5.54)).</p>
<p>One should take to devotional service without reservations and surrender everything to the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>That will make one happy in this life and the next.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear son, I am helpless and very much aggrieved.</p>
<p>You should not give up my company.</p>
<p>Just look at your lamenting father.</p>
<p>We are helpless because without a son we shall have to suffer the distress of going to the darkest hellish regions.</p>
<p>You are the only hope by which we can get out of these dark regions.</p>
<p>Therefore I request you not to go any further with the merciless Yama.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic injunctions, one must accept a wife just to beget a son who can deliver one from the clutches of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>Unless one has a son to offer oblations to the pitas, or forefathers, one must suffer in Yamaraja’s kingdom.</p>
<p>King Citraketu was very much aggrieved thinking that because his son was going away with Yamaraja he himself would again suffer.</p>
<p>The subtle laws exist for the karmis; if one becomes a devotee, he has no more obligations to the laws of karma.</p>

<p>My dear son, I am certainly most unfortunate, for I can no longer see your mild smiling.</p>
