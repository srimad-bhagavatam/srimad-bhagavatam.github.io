<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#611" id="611">6.11</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes Vrtrasura’s great qualities.</p>
<p>When the prominent commanders of the demons fled, not hearing Vrtrasura’s advice.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura condemned them all as cowards.</p>
<p>Speaking very bravely, he stood alone to face the demigods.</p>
<p>When the demigods saw Vrtrasura’s attitude, they were so afraid that they practically fainted, and Vrtrasura began trampling them down.</p>
<p>Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of the demigods, threw his club at Vrtrasura, but Vrtrasura was such a great hero that he easily caught the club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra’s elephant.</p>
<p>Struck by the blow of Vrtrasura, the elephant was pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back.</p>
<p>King Indra had first accepted Visvarupa as his priest and thereafter killed him.</p>
<p>Reminding Indra of his heinous activities, Vrtrasura said, If one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, and depends on Lord Visnu in every respect, then victory, opulence and peace of mind are all inevitably available.</p>
<p>Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is so kind that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>I wish always to chant the glories of the Lord and engage in His service.</p>
<p>Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make friendships with the devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>I do not desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, even to Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position within this material world.</p>
<p>I have no need for such things</p>
