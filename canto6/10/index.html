<h1>The Battle Between the Demigods and Vṛtrāsura</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>6.10</strong></p>
<p>As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhici, a thunderbolt was prepared from Dadhici’s bones, and a fight took place between Vrtrasura and the demigods.</p>
<p>Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadhici Muni and begged for his body.</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion, jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals.</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni first merged his gross body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus he gave up his gross body.</p>
<p>With the help of Visvakarma, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhici’s bones.</p>
<p>Armed with the thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.</p>
<p>At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga a great fight took place between the demigods and the asuras.</p>
<p>Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the asuras fled the battle leaving Vrtrasura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, however, seeing the demons fleeing, instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield.</p>
<p>One who is victorious in battle gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial heavens.</p>
<p>In either way, the fighter benefits.</p>

<p>However, just to hear religious instructions from them, he smiled and jokingly spoke as follows.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.3</strong></p>
<p>api vrndaraka yuyam</p>
<p>na janitha saririnam</p>
<p>samsthayam yas tv abhidroho</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.10.4</strong></p>
<p>jijivisunam jivanam</p>
<p>atma prestha ihepsitah</p>
<p>ka utsaheta tam datum</p>
<p>bhiksamanaya visnave</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, every living entity is very much addicted to his material body.</p>
<p>Struggling to keep his body forever, everyone tries to protect it by all means, even at the sacrifice of all his possessions.</p>
<p>Therefore, who would be prepared to deliver his body to anyone, even if it were demanded by Lord Visnu?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, atmanam sarvato rakset tato dharmam tato dhanam: one must protect his body by all means; then he may protect his religious principles and thereafter his possessions.</p>
<p>This is the natural desire of all living entities.</p>
<p>No one wants to give up his body unless it is forcibly given away.</p>
<p>Even though the demigods said that they were demanding Dadhici’s body for their benefit in accordance with the order of Lord Visnu, Dadhici superficially refused to give them his body.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.5</strong></p>
<p>sri-deva ucuh</p>
<p>kim nu tad dustyajam brahman</p>
<p>pumsam bhutanukampinam</p>
<p>bhavad-vidhanam mahatam</p>
<p>punya-slokedya-karmanam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-devah ucuh—the demigods said; kim—what; nu—indeed; tat—that; dustyajam—difficult to give up; brahman—O exalted brahmana; pumsam—of persons; bhuta-anukampinam—who are very sympathetic toward the suffering living entities; bhavat-vidhanam—like Your Lordship; mahatam—who are very great; punya-sloka-idya-karmanam—whose pious activities are praised by all great souls.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demigods replied: O exalted brahmana, pious persons like you, whose activities are praiseworthy, are very kind and affectionate to people in general.</p>
<p>What can’t such pious souls give for the benefit of others? They can give everything, including their bodies.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.6</strong></p>
<p>nunam svartha-paro loko</p>
<p>na veda para-sankatam</p>
<p>yadi veda na yaceta</p>
<p>neti naha yad isvarah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who are too self-interested beg something from others, not knowing of others’ pain.</p>
<p>But if the beggar knew the difficulty of the giver, he would not ask for anything.</p>
<p>Similarly, he who is able to give charity does not know the beggar’s difficulty, for otherwise he would not refuse to give the beggar anything he might want as charity.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse describes two people—one who gives charity and one who begs for it.</p>
<p>A beggar should not ask charity from a person who is in difficulty.</p>
<p>Similarly, one who is able to give charity should not deny a beggar.</p>
<p>These are the moral instructions of the sastra.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita says, san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati: everything within this material world will be destroyed, and therefore one should use everything for good purposes.</p>
<p>If one is advanced in knowledge, he must always be prepared to sacrifice anything for a better cause.</p>
<p>At the present moment the entire world is in a dangerous position under the spell of a godless civilization.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement needs many exalted, learned persons who will sacrifice their lives to revive God consciousness throughout the world.</p>
<p>We therefore invite all men and women advanced in knowledge to join the Krsna consciousness movement and sacrifice their lives for the great cause of reviving the God consciousness of human society.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.7</strong></p>
<p>sri-rsir uvaca</p>
<p>dharmam vah srotu-kamena</p>
<p>yuyam me pratyudahrtah</p>
<p>esa vah priyam atmanam</p>
<p>tyajantam santyajamy aham</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-rsih uvaca—the great saint Dadhici said; dharmam—the principles of religion; vah—from you; srotu-kamena—by the desire to hear; yuyam—you; me—by me; pratyudahrtah—replied to the contrary; esah—this; vah—for you; priyam—dear; atmanam—body; tyajantam—leaving me anyway, today or tomorrow; santyajami—give up; aham—I.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Dadhici said: Just to hear from you about religious principles, I refused to offer my body at your request.</p>
<p>Now, although my body is extremely dear to me, I must give it up for your better purposes since I know that it will leave me today or tomorrow.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.8</strong></p>
<p>yo ’dhruvenatmana natha</p>
<p>na dharmam na yasah puman</p>
<p>iheta bhuta-dayaya</p>
<p>sa socyah sthavarair api</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—anyone who; adhruvena—impermanent; atmana—by the body; nathah—O lords; na—not; dharmam—religious principles; na—not; yasah—fame; puman—a person; iheta—endeavors for; bhuta-dayaya—by mercy for the living beings; sah—that person; socyah—pitiable; sthavaraih—by the immobile creatures; api—even.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O demigods, one who has no compassion for humanity in its suffering and does not sacrifice his impermanent body for the higher causes of religious principles or eternal glory is certainly pitied even by the immovable beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the six Gosvamis of Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.34):</p>
<p>tyaktva sudustyaja-surepsita-rajya-laksmim</p>
<p>dharmistha arya-vacasa yad agad aranyam</p>
<p>maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad</p>
<p>vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam</p>
<p>We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord upon whom one should always meditate.</p>
<p>He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore.</p>
<p>He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material energy To accept sannyasa means to commit civil suicide but sannyasa is compulsory, at least for every brahmana, every first-class human being.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a very young and beautiful wife and a very affectionate mother.</p>
<p>Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all the fallen souls of the world, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa and left home when He was only twenty-four years old.</p>
<p>He lived a very strict life as a sannyasi, refusing all bodily comforts.</p>
<p>Similarly, His disciples the six Gosvamis were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left everything to join the movement of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Srinivasa Acarya says:</p>
<p>tyaktva turnam asesa-mandala-pati-srenim sada tucchavat</p>
<p>bhutva dina-ganesakau karunaya kaupina-kanthasritau</p>
<p>These Gosvamis left their very comfortable lives as ministers.</p>
<p>Zamindars and learned scholars and joined Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement, just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (dina-ganesakau karunaya).</p>
<p>Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and torn quilts (kaupina-kantha) they lived in Vrndavana and followed Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s order to excavate Vrndavana’s lost glories.</p>
<p>Similarly everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in this world should join the Krsna consciousness movement to elevate the fallen souls.</p>
<p>The words bhuta-dayaya, maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam and dina-ganesakau karunaya all convey the same sense.</p>
<p>These are very significant words for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life.</p>
<p>One should join the Krsna consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the six Gosvamis and, before them, the great sage Dadhici.</p>
<p>Instead of wasting one’s life for temporary bodily comforts one should always be prepared to give up one’s life for better causes.</p>
<p>After all, the body will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious principles throughout the world.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.9</strong></p>
<p>etavan avyayo dharmah</p>
<p>punya-slokair upasitah</p>
<p>yo bhuta-soka-harsabhyam</p>
<p>atma socati hrsyati</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>etavan—this much; avyayah—imperishable; dharmah—religious principle; punya-slokaih—by famous persons who are celebrated as pious; upasitah—recognized; yah—which; bhuta—of the living beings; soka—by the distress; harsabhyam—and by the happiness; atma—the mind; socati—laments; hrsyati—feels happiness.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and happy to see their happiness, his religious principles are appreciated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious and benevolent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>In this verse, however, real religious principles are explained.</p>
<p>Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others happy.</p>
<p>Atmavat sarva-bhutesu: one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own.</p>
<p>It is on this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence—ahimsah parama-dharmah—is established.</p>
<p>We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living beings.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha’s mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the greatest religious principle is nonviolence.</p>
<p>One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man.</p>
<p>That is the greatest hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ said, Do not kill but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of slaughterhouses while posing as Christians.</p>
<p>Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse.</p>
<p>One should be happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy.</p>
<p>This is the principle to be followed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals.</p>
<p>That is not recommended herein.</p>
<p>This verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether human animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):</p>
<p>sarva-yonisu kaunteya</p>
<p>murtayah sambhavanti yah</p>
<p>tasam brahma mahad yonir</p>
<p>aham bija-pradah pita</p>
<p>It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father The different forms of these living entities are only their external dresses.</p>
<p>Every living being is actually a spirit soul, a part and parcel of God.</p>
<p>Therefore one should not favor only one kind of living being.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava sees all living entities as part and parcel of God.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (5.18 and Bg.18.54):</p>
<p>vidya-vinaya-sampanne</p>
<p>brahmane gavi hastini</p>
<p>suni caiva svapake ca</p>
<p>panditah sama-darsinah</p>
<p>The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater (outcaste)</p>
<p>brahma-bhutah prasannatma</p>
<p>na socati na kanksati</p>
<p>samah sarvesu bhutesu</p>
<p>mad-bhaktim labhate param</p>
<p>(Bg.18.54)</p>
<p>One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.</p>
<p>He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity.</p>
<p>In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me A Vaisnava, therefore, is truly a perfect person because he laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at seeing others happy.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; he is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism.</p>
<p>Therefore a Vaisnava is always busy preaching Krsna consciousness throughout the world.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.10</strong></p>
<p>aho dainyam aho kastam</p>
<p>parakyaih ksana-bhanguraih</p>
<p>yan nopakuryad asvarthair</p>
<p>martyah sva-jnati-vigrahaih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aho—alas; dainyam—a miserable condition; aho—alas; kastam—simply tribulation; parakyaih—which after death are eatable by dogs and jackals; ksana-bhanguraih—perishable at any moment; yat—because; na—not; upakuryat—would help; a-sva-arthaih—not meant for self-interest; martyah—a living entity destined to die; sva—with his wealth; jnati—relatives and friends; vigrahaih—and his body.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This body, which is eatable by jackals and dogs after death, does not actually do any good for me, the spirit soul.</p>
<p>It is usable only for a short time and may perish at any moment.</p>
<p>The body and its possessions, its riches and relatives, must all be engaged for the benefit of others, or else they will be sources of tribulation and misery.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.22.35):</p>
<p>etavaj janma-saphalyam</p>
<p>dehinam iha dehisu</p>
<p>pranair arthair dhiya vaca</p>
<p>sreya-acaranam sada</p>
<p>It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence and words This is the mission of life.</p>
<p>One’s own body and the bodies of his friends and relatives, as well as one’s own riches and everything else one has, should be engaged for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>This is the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi9.41):</p>
<p>bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara</p>
<p>janma sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara</p>
<p>One who has taken birth as a human being in the land of India (Bharata-varsa) should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.</p>
<p>The word upakuryat means para-upakara, helping others.</p>
<p>Of course, in human society there are many institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity for philanthropy is ineffectual.</p>
<p>They do not know the ultimate goal of life (sreya acaranam), which is to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>If all philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achieving the ultimate goal of life—to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead—they would all be perfect.</p>
<p>Humanitarian work without Krsna is nothing.</p>
<p>Krsna must be brought to the center of all our activities; otherwise no activity will have value.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.11</strong></p>
<p>sri-badarayanir uvaca</p>
<p>evam krta-vyavasito</p>
<p>dadhyann atharvanas tanum</p>
<p>pare bhagavati brahmany</p>
<p>atmanam sannayan jahau</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-badarayanih uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam—thus; krta-vyavasitah—making certain of what to do (in giving his body to the demigods); dadhyan—Dadhici Muni; atharvanah—the son of Atharva; tanum—his body; pare—to the Supreme; bhagavati—Personality of Godhead; brahmani—the Supreme Brahman; atmanam—himself the spirit soul; sannayan—offering; jahau—gave up.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Dadhici Muni, the son of Atharva, thus resolved to give his body to the service of the demigods.</p>
<p>He placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material body made of five elements.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As indicated by the words pare bhagavati brahmany atmanam sannayan, Dadhici placed himself, as spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.13.55).</p>
<p>Dhrtarastra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of which it was made—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and distributed them to the different reservoirs of these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original mahat-tattva.</p>
<p>By identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The example given in this connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united with the large sky outside the pot.</p>
<p>Mayavadi philosophers misunderstand this description of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Therefore Sri Ramanuja Svami, in his book Vedanta-tattva-sara, has described that this merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements—earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence—the individual soul engages himself in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah/ anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>The material cause of the material elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position.</p>
<p>As described by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, jivera ‘svarupa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’: (Cc.Madhya 20.108) the constitutional position of the living entity is that he is the eternal servant of Krsna.</p>
<p>When one overcomes the material body through cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus engage in the service of the Lord.</p>



<p><strong>6.10.12</strong></p>
<p>yataksasu-mano-buddhis</p>
<p>tattva-drg dhvasta-bandhanah</p>
<p>asthitah paramam yogam</p>
<p>na deham bubudhe gatam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yata—controlled; aksa—senses; asu—the life air; manah—the mind; buddhih—intelligence; tattva-drk—one who knows the tattvas, the material and spiritual energies; dhvasta-bandhanah—liberated from bondage; asthitah—being situated in; paramam—the supreme; yogam—absorption, trance; na—not; deham—the material body; bubudhe—perceived; gatam—left.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dadhici Muni controlled his senses, life force, mind and intelligence and became absorbed in trance.</p>
<p>Thus he cut all his material bonds.</p>
<p>He could not perceive how his material body became separated from his self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (8.5):</p>
<p>anta-kale ca mam eva</p>
<p>smaran muktva kalevaram</p>
<p>yah prayati sa mad-bhavam</p>
<p>yati nasty atra samsayah</p>
<p>Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature.</p>
<p>Of this there is no doubt Of course, one must practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect yogi, namely the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Krsna.</p>
<p>He does not feel his material body being separated from his soul; the soul is immediately transferred to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: (Bg.4.9) the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again but is transferred back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This yoga, bhakti-yoga, is the highest yoga system, as explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (Bg.6.47):</p>
<p>yoginam api sarvesam</p>
<p>mad-gatenantaratmana</p>
<p>sraddhavan bhajate yo mam</p>
<p>sa me yuktatamo matah</p>
<p>Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all The bhakti-yogi always thinks of Krsna, and therefore at the time of death he can very easily transfer himself to Krsnaloka, without even perceiving the pains of death.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, at the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga, a fierce battle took place between the demigods and the demons on the bank of the Narmada.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Herein the Narmada does not mean the Narmada River in India.</p>
<p>The five sacred rivers in India—Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada, Kaveri and Krsna—are all celestial.</p>
<p>Like the Ganges River, the Narmada River also flows in the higher planetary systems.</p>
<p>The battle between the demigods and the demons took place in the higher planets.</p>
<p>The words prathame yuge mean in the beginning of the first millennium that is to say, in the beginning of the Vaivasvata manvantara.</p>
<p>In one day of Brahma there are fourteen Manus, who each live for seventy-one millenniums.</p>
<p>The four yugas—Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali—constitute one millennium.</p>
<p>We are presently in the manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam/ vivasvan manave praha (Bg.4.1)).</p>
<p>We are now in the twenty-eighth millennium of Vaivasvata Manu, but this fight took place in the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu’s first millennium.</p>
<p>One can historically calculate how long ago the battle took place.</p>
<p>Since each millennium consists of 4,300,000 years and we are now in the twenty-eighth millennium, some 120,400,000 years have passed since the battle took place on the bank of the River Narmada.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, death being inevitable, if one can gain promotion to the higher planetary systems and be always celebrated here by dying a suitable death, what man will not accept such a glorious death?</p>
