<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#610" id="610">6.10</a></strong></p>
<p>As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhici, a thunderbolt was prepared from Dadhici’s bones, and a fight took place between Vrtrasura and the demigods.</p>
<p>Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadhici Muni and begged for his body.</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion, jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals.</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni first merged his gross body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus he gave up his gross body.</p>
<p>With the help of Visvakarma, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhici’s bones.</p>
<p>Armed with the thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.</p>
<p>At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga a great fight took place between the demigods and the asuras.</p>
<p>Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the asuras fled the battle leaving Vrtrasura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, however, seeing the demons fleeing, instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield.</p>
<p>One who is victorious in battle gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial heavens.</p>
<p>In either way, the fighter benefits.</p>
