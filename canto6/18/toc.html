<h1><a class="header" href="#diti-vows-to-kill-king-indra" id="diti-vows-to-kill-king-indra">Diti Vows to Kill King Indra</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#618" id="618">6.18</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter gives the history of Diti, the wife of Kasyapa, and how she followed a vow to have a son who would kill Indra.</p>
<p>It also describes how Indra attempted to foil her plan by cutting to pieces the son within her womb.</p>
<p>In relation to Tvasta and his descendants, there is a description of the dynasty of the Adityas (sons of Aditi) and other demigods.</p>
<p>Prsni, the wife of Aditi’s fifth son named Savita, had three daughters—Savitri, Vyahrti and Trayi—and very exalted sons named Agnihotra, Pasu, Soma, Caturmasya and the five Mahayajnas.</p>
<p>Siddhi, the wife of Bhaga, had three sons, named Mahima, Vibhu and Prabhu, and she also had one daughter, whose name was Asi.</p>
<p>Dhata had four wives—Kuhu, Sinivali, Raka and Anumati—who had four sons, named Sayam, Darsa, Pratah and Purnamasa respectively.</p>
<p>Kriya, the wife of Vidhata, gave birth to the five Purisyas, who are representatives of five kinds of fire-gods.</p>
<p>Bhrgu, the mind-born son of Brahma, took his birth again from Carsani, the wife of Varuna, and the great sage Valmiki appeared from Varuna’s semen.</p>
<p>Agastya and Vasistha were two sons of Varuna and Mitra.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the beauty of Urvasi, Mitra and Varuna discharged semen, which they kept in an earthen pot.</p>
<p>From that pot, Agastya and Vasistha appeared.</p>
<p>Mitra had a wife named Revati, who gave birth to three sons—Utsarga, Arista and Pippala.</p>
<p>Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Indra was the eleventh.</p>
<p>Indra’s wife was named Paulomi (Sacidevi).</p>
<p>She gave birth to three sons—Jayanta, Rsabha and Midhusa.</p>
<p>By His own powers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>From His wife, whose name was Kirti, appeared a son named Brhatsloka.</p>
<p>Brhatsloka’s first son was known as Saubhaga.</p>
<p>This is a description of the sons of Aditi.</p>
<p>A description of Aditya Urukrama, who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be offered in the Eighth Canto.</p>
<p>The demons born of Diti are also described in this chapter.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Diti appeared the great saintly devotee Prahlada and also Bali, Prahlada’s grandson.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa were the first sons of Diti.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu and his wife, whose name was Kayadhu, had four sons—Samhlada, Anuhlada, Hlada and Prahlada.</p>
<p>They also had one daughter, whose name was Simhika.</p>
<p>In association with the demon Vipracit, Simhika bore a son named Rahu, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Krti, the wife of Samhlada, bore a son named Pancajana.</p>
<p>Hlada’s wife, whose name was Dhamani, gave birth to two sons—Vatapi and Ilvala.</p>
<p>Ilvala put Vatapi into the form of a ram and gave him to Agastya to eat.</p>
<p>Anuhlada, in the womb of his wife, Surya, begot two sons, named Baskala and Mahisa.</p>
<p>Prahlada’s son was known as Virocana, and his grandson was known as Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja had one hundred sons, of whom Bana was the eldest.</p>
<p>After describing the dynasty of the Adityas and the other demigods, Sukadeva Gosvami describes Diti’s sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods.</p>
<p>Just to help Indra, Lord Visnu had killed Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Because of this, Diti was very envious, and she was eager to have a son who could kill Indra.</p>
<p>By her service, she enchanted Kasyapa Muni in order to beg from him a greater son to do this.</p>
<p>In corroboration of the Vedic injunction vidvamsam api karsati, Kasyapa Muni was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request.</p>
<p>When, however, she requested a son who would kill Indra, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife Diti to follow the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself.</p>
<p>When Diti, following the instructions of Kasyapa, engaged in devotional service, Indra could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her activities.</p>
<p>One day, Indra had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts.</p>
<p>In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as the Maruts appeared, but because Diti had performed the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons became Vaisnavas.</p>
