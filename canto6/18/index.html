<h1>Diti Vows to Kill King Indra</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>6.18</strong></p>
<p>This chapter gives the history of Diti, the wife of Kasyapa, and how she followed a vow to have a son who would kill Indra.</p>
<p>It also describes how Indra attempted to foil her plan by cutting to pieces the son within her womb.</p>
<p>In relation to Tvasta and his descendants, there is a description of the dynasty of the Adityas (sons of Aditi) and other demigods.</p>
<p>Prsni, the wife of Aditi’s fifth son named Savita, had three daughters—Savitri, Vyahrti and Trayi—and very exalted sons named Agnihotra, Pasu, Soma, Caturmasya and the five Mahayajnas.</p>
<p>Siddhi, the wife of Bhaga, had three sons, named Mahima, Vibhu and Prabhu, and she also had one daughter, whose name was Asi.</p>
<p>Dhata had four wives—Kuhu, Sinivali, Raka and Anumati—who had four sons, named Sayam, Darsa, Pratah and Purnamasa respectively.</p>
<p>Kriya, the wife of Vidhata, gave birth to the five Purisyas, who are representatives of five kinds of fire-gods.</p>
<p>Bhrgu, the mind-born son of Brahma, took his birth again from Carsani, the wife of Varuna, and the great sage Valmiki appeared from Varuna’s semen.</p>
<p>Agastya and Vasistha were two sons of Varuna and Mitra.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the beauty of Urvasi, Mitra and Varuna discharged semen, which they kept in an earthen pot.</p>
<p>From that pot, Agastya and Vasistha appeared.</p>
<p>Mitra had a wife named Revati, who gave birth to three sons—Utsarga, Arista and Pippala.</p>
<p>Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Indra was the eleventh.</p>
<p>Indra’s wife was named Paulomi (Sacidevi).</p>
<p>She gave birth to three sons—Jayanta, Rsabha and Midhusa.</p>
<p>By His own powers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>From His wife, whose name was Kirti, appeared a son named Brhatsloka.</p>
<p>Brhatsloka’s first son was known as Saubhaga.</p>
<p>This is a description of the sons of Aditi.</p>
<p>A description of Aditya Urukrama, who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be offered in the Eighth Canto.</p>
<p>The demons born of Diti are also described in this chapter.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Diti appeared the great saintly devotee Prahlada and also Bali, Prahlada’s grandson.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa were the first sons of Diti.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu and his wife, whose name was Kayadhu, had four sons—Samhlada, Anuhlada, Hlada and Prahlada.</p>
<p>They also had one daughter, whose name was Simhika.</p>
<p>In association with the demon Vipracit, Simhika bore a son named Rahu, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Krti, the wife of Samhlada, bore a son named Pancajana.</p>
<p>Hlada’s wife, whose name was Dhamani, gave birth to two sons—Vatapi and Ilvala.</p>
<p>Ilvala put Vatapi into the form of a ram and gave him to Agastya to eat.</p>
<p>Anuhlada, in the womb of his wife, Surya, begot two sons, named Baskala and Mahisa.</p>
<p>Prahlada’s son was known as Virocana, and his grandson was known as Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja had one hundred sons, of whom Bana was the eldest.</p>
<p>After describing the dynasty of the Adityas and the other demigods, Sukadeva Gosvami describes Diti’s sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods.</p>
<p>Just to help Indra, Lord Visnu had killed Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Because of this, Diti was very envious, and she was eager to have a son who could kill Indra.</p>
<p>By her service, she enchanted Kasyapa Muni in order to beg from him a greater son to do this.</p>
<p>In corroboration of the Vedic injunction vidvamsam api karsati, Kasyapa Muni was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request.</p>
<p>When, however, she requested a son who would kill Indra, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife Diti to follow the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself.</p>
<p>When Diti, following the instructions of Kasyapa, engaged in devotional service, Indra could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her activities.</p>
<p>One day, Indra had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts.</p>
<p>In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as the Maruts appeared, but because Diti had performed the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons became Vaisnavas.</p>

<p><strong>6.18.22</strong></p>
<p>sri-suta uvaca</p>

<p>Sri Suta Gosvami said: O great sage Saunaka, after hearing Maharaja Pariksit speak respectfully and briefly on topics essential to hear, Sukadeva Gosvami, who was well aware of everything, praised his endeavor with great pleasure and replied.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit’s question was very much appreciated by Sukadeva Gosvami because although it was composed of a small number of words, it contained meaningful inquiries about how the sons of Diti, although born as demons, became demigods.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura stresses that even though Diti was very envious, her heart was purified because of a devotional attitude.</p>
<p>Another significant topic is that although Kasyapa Muni was a learned scholar and was advanced in spiritual consciousness, he nonetheless fell a victim to the inducement of his beautiful wife.</p>
<p>All these questions were posed in a small number of words, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated Maharaja Pariksit’s inquiry.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Just to help Indra, Lord Visnu killed the two brothers Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Because of their being killed, their mother, Diti, overwhelmed with lamentation and anger, contemplated as follows.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Indra, who is very much fond of sense gratification, has killed the two brothers Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu by means of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore Indra is cruel, hardhearted and sinful.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When dead, the bodies of all the rulers known as kings and great leaders will be transformed into worms, stool or ashes.</p>
<p>If one enviously kills others for the protection of such a body, does he actually know the true interest of life? Certainly he does not, for if one is envious of other entities, he surely goes to hell.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material body, even if possessed by a great king, is ultimately transformed into stool, worms or ashes.</p>
<p>When one is too attached to the bodily conception of life, he is certainly not very intelligent.</p>

<p>Let me adopt some means to help me in this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is in the bodily conception of life is compared in the sastras to animals like cows and asses.</p>
<p>Diti wanted to punish Indra, who had become like a lower animal.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thinking in this way (with a desire for a son to kill Indra), Diti began constantly acting to satisfy Kasyapa by her pleasing behavior.</p>
<p>O King, Diti always carried out Kasyapa’s orders very faithfully, as he desired.</p>
<p>With service, love, humility and control, with words spoken very sweetly to satisfy her husband, and with smiles and glances at him, Diti attracted his mind and brought it under her control.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When a woman wants to endear herself to her husband and make him very faithful, she must try to please him in all respects.</p>
<p>When the husband is pleased with his wife, the wife can receive all necessities, ornaments and full satisfaction for her senses.</p>
<p>Herein this is indicated by the behavior of Diti.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although Kasyapa Muni was a learned scholar, he was captivated by Diti’s artificial behavior, which brought him under her control.</p>
<p>Therefore he assured his wife that he would fulfill her desires.</p>
<p>Such a promise by a husband is not at all astonishing.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vilokya—seeing; ekanta-bhutani—detached; bhutani—the living entities; adau—in the beginning; prajapatih—Lord Brahma; striyam—the woman; cakre—created; sva-deha—of his body; ardham—half; yaya—by whom; pumsam—of men; matih—the mind; hrta—carried away.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma, the father of the living entities of the universe, saw that all the living entities were unattached.</p>
<p>To increase population, he then created woman from the better half of man’s body, for woman’s behavior carries away a man’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This entire universe is going on under the spell of sexual attachment, which was created by Lord Brahma to increase the population of the entire universe, not only in human society but also in other species.</p>
<p>As stated by Rsabhadeva in the Fifth Canto, pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam: the entire world is going on under the spell of sexual attraction and desire between man and woman.</p>
<p>When man and woman unite, the hard knot of this attraction becomes increasingly tight, and thus a man is implicated in the materialistic way of life.</p>
<p>This is the illusion of the material world.</p>
<p>This illusion acted upon Kasyapa Muni, although he was very learned and advanced in spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.19.17) :</p>
<p>matra svasra duhitra va</p>
<p>naviviktasano bhavet</p>
<p>balavan indriya-gramo</p>
<p>vidvamsam api karsati</p>
<p>A man should not associate with a woman in a solitary place, not even with his mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so strong that they lead astray even a person advanced in knowledge When a man remains in a solitary place with a woman, his sexual desires undoubtedly increase.</p>
<p>Therefore the words ekanta-bhutani, which are used here, indicate that to avoid sexual desires one should avoid the company of women as far as possible.</p>
<p>Sexual desire is so powerful that one is saturated with it if he stays in a solitary place with any woman, even his mother, sister or daughter.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>patih—the husband; eva—indeed; hi—certainly; narinam—of women; daivatam—demigod; paramam—supreme; smrtam—is considered; manasah—situated in the heart; sarva-bhutanam—of all living entities; vasudevah—Vasudeva; sriyah—of the goddess of fortune; patih—the husband; sah—He; eva—certainly; devata-lingaih—by the forms of the demigods; nama—names; rupa—forms; vikalpitaih—conceived; ijyate—is worshiped; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; pumbhih—by men; stribhih—by women; ca—also; pati-rupa-dhrk—in the form of the husband.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A husband is the supreme demigod for a woman.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vasudeva, the husband of the goddess of fortune, is situated in everyone’s heart and is worshiped through the various names and forms of the demigods by fruitive workers.</p>
<p>Similarly, a husband represents the Lord as the object of worship for a woman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):</p>
<p>ye ’py anya-devata-bhakta</p>
<p>yajante sraddhayanvitah</p>
<p>te ’pi mam eva kaunteya</p>
<p>yajanty avidhi-purvakam</p>
<p>Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding The demigods are various assistants who act like the hands and legs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as various parts of the Lord.</p>
<p>If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their husbands as representatives of Vasudeva, the women benefit, just as Ajamila benefited by calling for Narayana, his son.</p>
<p>Ajamila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of Narayana, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name.</p>
<p>In India a husband is still called pati-guru, the husband spiritual master.</p>
<p>If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in Krsna consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement.</p>
<p>Although the names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic mantras (indraya svaha, agnaye svaha), the Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>As long as one is very much attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one’s husband is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear wife, whose body is so beautiful, your waist being thin, a conscientious wife should be chaste and should abide by the orders of her husband.</p>
<p>She should very devoutly worship her husband as a representative of Vasudeva.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ditih uvaca—Diti said; vara-dah—the giver of benedictions; yadi—if; me—to me; brahman—O great soul; putram—a son; indra-hanam—who can kill Indra; vrne—I am asking for; amrtyum—immortal; mrta-putra—whose sons are dead; aham—I; yena—by whom; me—my; ghatitau—were caused to be killed; sutau—two sons.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Diti replied: O my husband, O great soul, I have now lost my sons.</p>
<p>If you want to give me a benediction, I ask you for an immortal son who can kill Indra.</p>
<p>I pray for this because Indra, with the help of Visnu, has killed my two sons Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word indra-hanam means one who can kill Indra but it also means one who follows Indra The word amrtyum refers to the demigods, who do not die like ordinary human beings because they have extremely long durations of life.</p>
<p>For example, the duration of Lord Brahma’s life is stated in Bhagavad-gita: sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh (Bg.8.17).</p>
<p>Even the duration of one day, or twelve hours, of Brahma is 4,300,000 years multiplied by one thousand.</p>
<p>Thus the duration of his life is inconceivable for an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>The demigods are therefore sometimes called amara, which means one who has no death In this material world, however, everyone has to die.</p>
<p>Therefore the word amrtyum indicates that Diti wanted a son who would be equal in status to the demigods.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Upon hearing Diti’s request, Kasyapa Muni was very much aggrieved Alas he lamented, now I face the danger of the impious act of killing Indra</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Kasyapa Muni was eager to fulfill the desire of his wife Diti, when he heard that she wanted a son to kill Indra his jubilation was immediately reduced to nothing because he was averse to the idea.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni thought: Alas, I have now become too attached to material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this, my mind has been attracted by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of a woman (my wife).</p>
<p>Therefore I am surely a wretched person who will glide down toward hell.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kah—what; atikramah—offense; anuvartantyah—following; sva-bhavam—her nature; iha—here; yositah—of the woman; dhik—condemnation; mam—unto me; bata—alas; abudham—not conversant; sva-arthe—in what is good for me; yat—because; aham—I; tu—indeed; ajita-indriyah—unable to control my senses.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This woman, my wife, has adopted a means that follows her nature, and therefore she is not to be blamed.</p>
<p>But I am a man.</p>
<p>Therefore, all condemnation upon me! I am not at all conversant with what is good for me, since I could not control my senses.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The natural instinct of a woman is to enjoy the material world.</p>
<p>She induces her husband to enjoy this world by satisfying his tongue, belly and genitals, which are called jihva, udara and upastha.</p>
<p>A woman is expert in cooking palatable dishes so that she can easily satisfy her husband in eating.</p>
<p>When one eats nicely, his belly is satisfied, and as soon as the belly is satisfied the genitals become strong.</p>
<p>Especially when a man is accustomed to eating meat and drinking wine and similar passionate things, he certainly becomes sexually inclined.</p>
<p>It should be understood that sexual inclinations are meant not for spiritual progress but for gliding down to hell.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni considered his situation and lamented.</p>
<p>In other words, to be a householder is very risky unless one is trained and the wife is a follower of her husband.</p>
<p>A husband should be trained at the very beginning of his life.</p>
<p>Kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan iha (Bhag.7.6.1).</p>
<p>During the time of brahmacarya, or student life, a brahmacari should be taught to be expert in bhagavata-dharma, devotional service.</p>
<p>Then when he marries, if his wife is faithful to her husband and follows him in such life, the relationship between husband and wife is very desirable.</p>
<p>However, a relationship between husband and wife without spiritual consciousness but strictly for sense gratification is not at all good.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.3) that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, dam-patye ’bhirucir hetuh: the relationship between husband and wife will be based on sexual power.</p>
<p>Therefore householder life in this Kali-yuga is extremely dangerous unless both the wife and husband take to Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sarat—in the autumn; padma—a lotus flower; utsavam—blossoming; vaktram—face; vacah—words; ca—and; sravana—to the ear; amrtam—giving pleasure; hrdayam—heart; ksura-dhara—the blade of a razor; abham—like; strinam—of women; kah—who; veda—knows; cestitam—the dealings.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s face is as attractive and beautiful as a blossoming lotus flower during autumn.</p>
<p>Her words are very sweet, and they give pleasure to the ear, but if we study a woman’s heart, we can understand it to be extremely sharp, like the blade of a razor.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, who could understand the dealings of a woman?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Woman is now depicted very well from the materialistic point of view by Kasyapa Muni.</p>
<p>Women are generally known as the fair sex, and especially in youth, at the age of sixteen or seventeen, women are very attractive to men.</p>
<p>Therefore a woman’s face is compared to a blooming lotus flower in autumn.</p>
<p>Just as a lotus is extremely beautiful in autumn, a woman at the threshold of youthful beauty is extremely attractive.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit a woman’s voice is called nari-svara because women generally sing and their singing is very attractive.</p>
<p>At the present moment, cinema artists, especially female singers, are especially welcome.</p>
<p>Some of them earn fabulous amounts of money simply by singing.</p>
<p>Therefore, as taught by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, a woman’s singing is dangerous because it can make a sannyasi fall a victim to the woman.</p>
<p>Sannyasa means giving up the company of women, but if a sannyasi hears the voice of a woman and sees her beautiful face, he certainly becomes attracted and is sure to fall down.</p>
<p>There have been many examples.</p>
<p>Even the great sage Visvamitra fell a victim to Menaka.</p>
<p>Therefore a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must be especially careful not to see a woman’s face or hear a woman’s voice.</p>
<p>To see a woman’s face and appreciate its beauty or to hear a woman’s voice and appreciate her singing as very nice is a subtle falldown for a brahmacari or sannyasi.</p>
<p>Thus the description of a woman’s features by Kasyapa Muni is very instructive.</p>
<p>When a woman’s bodily features are attractive, when her face is beautiful and when her voice is sweet, she is naturally a trap for a man.</p>
<p>The sastras advise that when such a woman comes to serve a man, she should be considered to be like a dark well covered by grass.</p>
<p>In the fields there are many such wells, and a man who does not know about them drops through the grass and falls down.</p>
<p>Thus there are many such instructions.</p>
<p>Since the attraction of the material world is based on attraction for women, Kasyapa Muni thought, Under the circumstances, who can understand the heart of a woman Canakya Pandita has also advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: There are two persons one should not trust—a politician and a woman These, of course, are authoritative sastric injunctions, and we should therefore be very careful in our dealings with women.</p>
<p>Sometimes our Krsna consciousness movement is criticized for mingling men and women, but Krsna consciousness is meant for anyone.</p>
<p>Whether one is a man or woman does not matter.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna personally says, striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te ’pi yanti param gatim: whether one is a woman, sudra or vaisya, not to speak of being a brahmana or ksatriya, everyone is fit to return home, back to Godhead, if he strictly follows the instructions of the spiritual master and sastra.</p>
<p>We therefore request all the members of the Krsna consciousness movement—both men and women—not to be attracted by bodily features but only to be attracted by Krsna.</p>
<p>Then everything will be all right.</p>
<p>Otherwise there will be danger.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; hi—certainly; kascit—anyone; priyah—dear; strinam—to women; anjasa—actually; sva-asisa—for their own interests; atmanam—most dear; patim—husband; putram—son; bhrataram—brother; va—or; ghnanti—they kill; arthe—for their own interests; ghatayanti—cause to be killed; ca—also.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To satisfy their own interests, women deal with men as if the men were most dear to them, but no one is actually dear to them.</p>
<p>Women are supposed to be very saintly, but for their own interests they can kill even their husbands, sons or brothers, or cause them to be killed by others.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s nature has been particularly well studied by Kasyapa Muni.</p>
<p>Women are self-interested by nature, and therefore they should be protected by all means so that their natural inclination to be too self-interested will not be manifested.</p>
<p>Women need to be protected by men.</p>
<p>A woman should be cared for by her father in her childhood, by her husband in her youth and by her grown sons in her old age.</p>
<p>This is the injunction of Manu, who says that a woman should not be given independence at any stage.</p>
<p>Women must be cared for so that they will not be free to manifest their natural tendency for gross selfishness.</p>
<p>There have been many cases, even in the present day, in which women have killed their husbands to take advantage of their insurance policies.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of women but a practical study of their nature.</p>
<p>Such natural instincts of a woman or a man are manifested only in the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>When either a man or a woman is advanced in spiritual consciousness, the bodily conception of life practically vanishes.</p>
<p>We should see all women as spiritual units (aham brahmasmi), whose only duty is to satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>Then the influences of the different modes of material nature, which result from one’s possessing a material body, will not act.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is so beneficial that it can very easily counteract the contamination of material nature, which results from one’s possessing a material body.Bhagavad-gita therefore teaches, in the very beginning, that whether one is a man or a woman, one must know that he or she is not the body but a spiritual soul.</p>
<p>Everyone should be interested in the activities of the spirit soul, not the body.</p>
<p>As long as one is activated by the bodily conception of life, there is always the danger of being misled, whether one is a man or a woman.</p>
<p>The soul is sometimes described as purusa because whether one is dressed as a man or a woman, one is inclined to enjoy this material world.</p>
<p>One who has this spirit of enjoyment is described as purusa.</p>
<p>Whether one is a man or a woman, he is not interested in serving others; everyone is interested in satisfying his or her own senses.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness, however, provides first-class training for a man or a woman.</p>
<p>A man should be trained to be a first-class devotee of Lord Krsna, and a woman should be trained to be a very chaste follower of her husband.</p>
<p>That will make the lives of both of them happy.</p>

<p>pratisrutam dadamiti</p>
<p>vacas tan na mrsa bhavet</p>
<p>vadham narhati cendro ’pi</p>
<p>tatredam upakalpate</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>pratisrutam—promised; dadami—I shall give; iti—thus; vacah—statement; tat—that; na—not; mrsa—false; bhavet—can be; vadham—killing; na—not; arhati—is suitable; ca—and; indrah—Indra; api—also; tatra—in that connection; idam—this; upakalpate—is suitable.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I promised to give her a benediction, and this promise cannot be violated, but Indra does not deserve to be killed.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, the solution I have is quite suitable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni concluded, Diti is eager to have a son who can kill Indra, since she is a woman, after all, and is not very intelligent.</p>
<p>I shall train her in such a way that instead of always thinking of how to kill Indra, she will become a Vaisnava, a devotee of Krsna.</p>
<p>If she agrees to follow the rules and regulations of the Vaisnava principles, the unclean core of her heart will certainly be cleansed Ceto-darpana-marjanam (Cc.Antya 20.12).</p>
<p>This is the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>Anyone can be purified by following the principles of devotional service in Krsna consciousness, for Krsna consciousness is so powerful that it can purify even the dirtiest class of men and transform them into the topmost Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement aims at this purpose.</p>
<p>Narottama dasa Thakura says:</p>
<p>balarama ha-ila nitai</p>
<p>ta’ra saksi jagai-madhai</p>
<p>The appearance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in this Kali-yuga is especially meant to deliver the fallen souls, who are always planning something for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>He gave the people of this age the advantage of being able to chant the Hare Krsna mantra and thus become fully pure, free from all material contamination.</p>
<p>Once one becomes a pure Vaisnava, he transcends all material conceptions of life.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni tried to transform his wife into a Vaisnavi so that she might give up the idea of killing Indra.</p>
<p>He wanted both her and her sons to be purified so that they would be fit to become pure Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes a practitioner deviates from the Vaisnava principles, and there is a chance that he may fall down, but Kasyapa Muni thought that even if one falls while practicing the Vaisnava principles, he is still not a loser.</p>
<p>Even a fallen Vaisnava is eligible for better results, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even practicing the Vaisnava principles to a small extent can save one from the greatest danger of material existence.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni planned to instruct his wife Diti to become a Vaisnava because he wanted to save the life of Indra.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>iti—thus; sancintya—thinking; bhagavan—the powerful; maricah—Kasyapa Muni; kuru-nandana—O descendant of Kuru; uvaca—spoke; kincit—somewhat; kupitah—angry; atmanam—himself; ca—and; vigarhayan—condemning.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Kasyapa Muni, thinking in this way, became somewhat angry.</p>
<p>Condemning himself, O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of Kuru, he spoke to Diti as follows.</p>



<p><strong>6.18.45</strong></p>
<p>sri-kasyapa uvaca</p>
<p>putras te bhavita bhadre</p>
<p>indra-hadeva-bandhavah</p>
<p>samvatsaram vratam idam</p>
<p>yady anjo dharayisyasi</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-kasyapah uvaca—Kasyapa Muni said; putrah—son; te—your; bhavita—will be; bhadre—O gentle woman; indra-ha—killer of Indra, or follower of Indra; adeva-bandhavah—friend of the demons (or deva-bandhavah—friend of the demigods); samvatsaram—for a year; vratam—vow; idam—this; yadi—if; anjah—properly; dharayisyasi—you will execute.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni said: My dear gentle wife, if you follow my instructions regarding this vow for at least one year, you will surely get a son who will be able to kill Indra.</p>
<p>However, if you deviate from this vow of following the Vaisnava principles, you will get a son who will be favorable to Indra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word indra-ha refers to an asura who is always eager to kill Indra.</p>
<p>An enemy of Indra is naturally a friend to the asuras, but the word indra-ha also refers to one who follows Indra or who is obedient to him.</p>
<p>When one becomes a devotee of Indra, he is certainly a friend to the demigods.</p>
<p>Thus the words indra-hadeva-bandhavah are equivocal, for they say, Your son will kill Indra, but he will be very friendly to the demigods If a person actually became a friend of the demigods, he certainly would not be able to kill Indra.</p>

<p>bruhi karyani yani me</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ditih uvaca—Diti said; dharayisye—I shall accept; vratam—vow; brahman—my dear brahmana; bruhi—please state; karyani—must be done; yani—what; me—to me; yani—what; ca—and; iha—here; nisiddhani—is forbidden; na—not; vratam—the vow; ghnanti—break; yani—what; uta—also.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Diti replied: My dear brahmana, I must accept your advice and follow the vow.</p>
<p>Now let me understand what I have to do, what is forbidden and what will not break the vow.</p>
<p>Please clearly state all this to me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, a woman is generally inclined to serve her own purposes.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni proposed to train Diti to fulfill her desires within one year, and since she was eager to kill Indra, she immediately agreed, saying, Please let me know what the vow is and how I have to follow it.</p>
<p>I promise that I shall do the needful and not break the vow This is another side of a woman’s psychology.</p>
<p>Even though a woman is very fond of fulfilling her own plans, when someone instructs her, especially her husband, she innocently follows, and thus she can be trained for better purposes.</p>
<p>By nature a woman wants to be a follower of a man; therefore if the man is good the woman can be trained for a good purpose.</p>



<p><strong>6.18.47</strong></p>
<p>sri-kasyapa uvaca</p>
<p>na himsyad bhuta-jatani</p>
<p>na sapen nanrtam vadet</p>
<p>na chindyan nakha-romani</p>
<p>na sprsed yad amangalam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-kasyapah uvaca—Kasyapa Muni said; na himsyat—must not harm; bhuta-jatani—the living entities; na sapet—must not curse; na—not; anrtam—a lie; vadet—must speak; na chindyat—must not cut; nakha-romani—the nails and hair; na sprset—must not touch; yat—that which; amangalam—impure.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni said: My dear wife, to follow this vow, do not be violent or cause harm to anyone.</p>
<p>Do not curse anyone, and do not speak lies.</p>
<p>Do not cut your nails and hair, and do not touch impure things like skulls and bones.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni’s first instruction to his wife was not to be envious.</p>
<p>The general tendency of anyone within this material world is to be envious, and therefore, to become a Krsna conscious person, one must curb this tendency, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (paramo nirmatsaranam).</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is always nonenvious, whereas others are always envious.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni’s instruction that his wife not be envious indicates that this is the first stage of advancement in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni desired to train his wife to be a Krsna conscious person, for this would suffice to protect both her and Indra.</p>

<p>na—not; apsu—in water; snayat—must bathe; na kupyeta—must not become angry; na sambhaseta—must not speak; durjanaih—with wicked persons; na vasita—must not wear; adhauta-vasah—unwashed clothes; srajam—flower garland; ca—and; vidhrtam—which was already worn; kvacit—ever.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni continued: My dear gentle wife, never enter the water while bathing, never be angry, and do not even speak or associate with wicked people.</p>
<p>Never wear clothes that have not been properly washed, and do not put on a garland that has already been worn.</p>

<p>samisam vrsalahrtam</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; ucchistam—leftover food; candika-annam—food offered to the goddess Kali; ca—and; sa-amisam—mixed with flesh; vrsala-ahrtam—brought by a sudra; bhunjita—must eat; udakyaya—by a woman in her menstrual period; drstam—seen; pibet na—must not drink; anjalina—by joining and cupping the two palms; tu—also; apah—water.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Never eat leftover food, never eat prasada offered to the goddess Kali (Durga), and do not eat anything contaminated by flesh or fish.</p>
<p>Do not eat anything brought or touched by a sudra nor anything seen by a woman in her menstrual period.</p>
<p>Do not drink water by joining your palms.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Generally the goddess Kali is offered food containing meat and fish, and therefore Kasyapa Muni strictly forbade his wife to take the remnants of such food.</p>
<p>Actually a Vaisnava is not allowed to take any food offered to the demigods.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is always fixed in accepting prasada offered to Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Through all these instructions, Kasyapa Muni, in a negative way, instructed his wife Diti how to become a Vaisnavi.</p>

<p>sandhyayam mukta-murdhaja</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; ucchista—after eating; asprsta-salila—without washing; sandhyayam—in the evening; mukta-murdhaja—with the hair loose; anarcita—without ornaments; asamyata-vak—without being grave; na—not; asamvita—without being covered; bahih—outside; caret—should go.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After eating, you should not go out to the street without having washed your mouth, hands and feet.</p>
<p>You should not go out in the evening or with your hair loose, nor should you go out unless you are properly decorated with ornaments.</p>
<p>You should not leave the house unless you are very grave and are sufficiently covered.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni advised his wife not to go out onto the street unless she was well decorated and well dressed.</p>
<p>He did not encourage the miniskirts that have now become fashionable.</p>
<p>In Oriental civilization, when a woman goes out onto the street, she must be fully covered so that no man will recognize who she is.</p>
<p>All these methods are to be accepted for purification.</p>
<p>If one takes to Krsna consciousness, one is fully purified, and thus one remains always transcendental to the contamination of the material world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You should not lie down without having washed both of your feet or without being purified, nor with wet feet or with your head pointed west or north.</p>
<p>You should not lie naked, or with other women, or during the sunrise or sunset.</p>

<p>dhauta-vasa—wearing washed cloth; sucih—being purified; nityam—always; sarva-mangala—with all auspicious items; samyuta—adorned; pujayet—one should worship; pratah-asat prak—before breakfast; go-vipran—the cows and brahmanas; sriyam—the goddess of fortune; acyutam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Putting on washed clothing, being always pure and being adorned with turmeric, sandalwood pulp and other auspicious items, before breakfast one should worship the cows, the brahmanas, the goddess of fortune and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one is trained to honor and worship the cows and brahmanas, he is actually civilized.</p>
<p>The worship of the Supreme Lord is recommended, and the Lord is very fond of the cows and brahmanas (namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca).</p>
<p>In other words, a civilization in which there is no respect for the cows and brahmanas is condemned.</p>
<p>One cannot become spiritually advanced without acquiring the brahminical qualifications and giving protection to cows.</p>
<p>Cow protection insures sufficient food prepared with milk, which is needed for an advanced civilization.</p>
<p>One should not pollute civilization by eating the flesh of cows.</p>
<p>A civilization must do something progressive, and then it is an Aryan civilization.</p>
<p>Instead of killing the cow to eat flesh, civilized men must prepare various milk products that will enhance the condition of society.</p>
<p>If one follows the brahminical culture, he will become competent in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>With flower garlands, sandalwood pulp, ornaments and other paraphernalia, a woman following this vow should worship women who have sons and whose husbands are living.</p>
<p>The pregnant wife should worship her husband and offer him prayers.</p>
<p>She should meditate upon him, thinking that he is situated in her womb.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The child in the womb is a part of the husband’s body.</p>
<p>Therefore the husband, through his representative, indirectly remains within the womb of his pregnant wife.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni continued: If you perform this ceremony called pumsavana, adhering to the vow with faith for at least one year, you will give birth to a son destined to kill Indra.</p>
<p>But if there is any discrepancy in the discharge of this vow, the son will be a friend to Indra.</p>

<p>O King Pariksit, Diti, the wife of Kasyapa, agreed to undergo the purificatory process known as pumsavana Yes she said, I shall do everything according to your instructions With great jubilation she became pregnant, having taken semen from Kasyapa, and faithfully began discharging the vow.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, who are respectful to everyone, Indra understood Diti’s purpose, and thus he contrived to fulfill his own interests.</p>
<p>Following the logic that self-preservation is the first law of nature, he wanted to break Diti’s promise.</p>
<p>Thus he engaged himself in the service of Diti, his aunt, who was residing in an asrama.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, as the hunter of a deer becomes like a deer by covering his body with deerskin and serving the deer, so Indra, although at heart the enemy of the sons of Diti, became outwardly friendly and served Diti in a faithful way.</p>
<p>Indra’s purpose was to cheat Diti as soon as he could find some fault in the way she discharged the vows of the ritualistic ceremony.</p>
<p>However, he wanted to be undetected, and therefore he served her very carefully.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Finding this fault, Indra, who has all the mystic powers (the yoga-siddhis such as anima and laghima), entered Diti’s womb while she was unconscious, being fast asleep.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A perfectly successful yogi is expert in eight kinds of perfection.</p>
<p>By one of them, called anima-siddhi, he can become smaller than an atom, and in that state he can enter anywhere.</p>
<p>With this yogic power, Indra entered the womb of Diti while she was pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After entering Diti’s womb, Indra, with the help of his thunderbolt, cut into seven pieces her embryo, which appeared like glowing gold.</p>
<p>In seven places, seven different living beings began crying.</p>
<p>Indra told them, Do not cry and then he cut each of them into seven pieces again.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Indra, by his yogic power, first expanded the body of the one Marut into seven, and then when he cut each of the seven parts of the original body into pieces, there were forty-nine.</p>
<p>When each body was cut into seven, other living entities entered the new bodies, and thus they were like plants, which become separate entities when cut into various parts and planted on a hill.</p>
<p>The first body was one, and when it was cut into many pieces, many other living entities entered the new bodies.</p>

<p>Because of such strength in spiritual life, the forty-nine Maruts were born.</p>

<p>When Diti, Indra’s aunt, explained to Indra without reservations what she had wanted to do, Indra explained his intentions to her.</p>

<p>yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana</p>
<p>sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah</p>

<p>My dear mother, when I saw that all forty-nine sons were alive, I was certainly struck with wonder.</p>
<p>I decided that this was a secondary result of your having regularly executed devotional service in worship of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>For one who engages in worshiping Lord Visnu, nothing is very wonderful.</p>
<p>This is a fact.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (18.78) it is said:</p>
<p>yatra yogesvarah krsno</p>
<p>yatra partho dhanur-dharah</p>
<p>tatra srir vijayo bhutir</p>
<p>dhruva nitir matir mama</p>
<p>Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.</p>
<p>That is my opinion Yogesvara is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all mystic yoga, who can do anything and everything He likes.</p>
<p>This is the omnipotence of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>For one who pleases the Supreme Lord, no achievement is wonderful.</p>
<p>Everything is possible for him.</p>



<p><strong>6.18.74</strong></p>
<p>aradhanam bhagavata</p>
<p>ihamana nirasisah</p>
<p>ye tu necchanty api param</p>
<p>te svartha-kusalah smrtah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aradhanam—the worship; bhagavatah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ihamanah—being interested in; nirasisah—without material desires; ye—those who; tu—indeed; na icchanti—do not desire; api—even; param—liberation; te—they; sva-artha—in their own interest; kusalah—expert; smrtah—are considered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although those who are interested only in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not desire anything material from the Lord and do not even want liberation, Lord Krsna fulfills all their desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Dhruva Maharaja saw Lord Visnu, he declined to take any benedictions from Him, for he was fully satisfied by seeing the Lord.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that because Dhruva Maharaja, in the beginning, had desired a kingdom greater than his father’s, he was promoted to Dhruvaloka, the best plane in the universe.</p>
<p>Therefore in the sastra it is said:</p>
<p>akamah sarva-kamo va</p>
<p>moksa-kama udara-dhih</p>
<p>tivrena bhakti-yogena</p>
<p>yajeta purusam param</p>
<p>A person who has broader intelligence, whether he is full of material desires, free from material desires, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead (Bhag.2.3.10) One should engage in full devotional service.</p>
<p>Then, even though he has no desires, whatever desires he previously had can all be fulfilled simply by his worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>The actual devotee does not desire even liberation (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)).</p>
<p>The Lord, however, fulfills the desire of the devotee by awarding him opulence that will never be destroyed.</p>
<p>A karmi’s opulence is destroyed, but the opulence of a devotee is never destroyed.</p>
<p>A devotee becomes more and more opulent as he increases his devotional service to the Lord.</p>



<p><strong>6.18.75</strong></p>
<p>aradhyatma-pradam devam</p>
<p>svatmanam jagad-isvaram</p>
<p>ko vrnita guna-sparsam</p>
<p>budhah syan narake ’pi yat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aradhya—after worshiping; atma-pradam—who gives Himself; devam—the Lord; sva-atmanam—the most dear; jagat-isvaram—the Lord of the universe; kah—what; vrnita—would choose; guna-sparsam—material happiness; budhah—intelligent person; syat—is; narake—in hell; api—even; yat—which.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of all ambitions is to become a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If an intelligent man serves the most dear Lord, who gives Himself to His devotees, how can he desire material happiness, which is available even in hell?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>An intelligent man will never aspire to become a devotee to achieve material happiness.</p>
<p>That is the test of a devotee.</p>
<p>As Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu teaches:</p>
<p>na dhanam na janam na sundarim</p>
<p>kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye</p>
<p>mama janmani janmanisvare</p>
<p>bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi</p>
<p>O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire beautiful women, nor do I want any number of followers.</p>
<p>I only want Your causeless devotional service birth after birth A pure devotee never begs the Lord for material happiness in the shape of riches, followers, a good wife or even mukti.</p>
<p>The Lord promises, however, yoga-ksemam vahamy aham: (Bg.9.22) I voluntarily bring everything necessary for My service</p>



<p><strong>6.18.76</strong></p>
<p>tad idam mama daurjanyam</p>
<p>balisasya mahiyasi</p>
<p>ksantum arhasi matas tvam</p>
<p>distya garbho mrtotthitah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my mother, O best of all women, I am a fool.</p>
<p>Kindly excuse me for whatever offenses I have committed.</p>
<p>Your forty-nine sons have been born unhurt because of your devotional service.</p>
<p>As an enemy, I cut them to pieces, but because of your great devotional service they did not die.</p>

<p>Then Indra offered his respects to his aunt with profuse obeisances, and with her permission he went away to the heavenly planes with his brothers the Maruts.</p>

<p>Now you may inquire further, and I shall explain more.</p>
