<h1>The Nārāyaṇa-kavaca Shield</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>6.8</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, was victorious over the soldiers of the demons, and it also describes the shield of the Visnu mantra.</p>
<p>To take protection from this shield, one must first touch kusa grass and wash one’s mouth with acamana-mantras.</p>
<p>One should observe silence and then place the eight-syllable Visnu mantra on the parts of his body and place the twelve-syllable mantra on his hands.</p>
<p>The eight-syllable mantra is om namo narayanaya.</p>
<p>This mantra should be distributed all over the front and back of the body.</p>
<p>The twelve-syllable mantra, which begins with the pranava, omkara, is om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.</p>
<p>One syllable should be placed on each of the fingers and should be preceded by the pranava, omkara.</p>
<p>Thereafter, one must chant om visnave namah, which is a six-syllable mantra.</p>
<p>One must progressively place the syllables of the mantra on the heart, the head, between the two eyebrows, on the sikha and between the eyes, and then one should chant mah astraya phat and with this mantra protect himself from all directions.</p>
<p>Nadevo devam arcayet: one who has not risen to the level of a deva cannot chant this mantra.</p>
<p>According to this direction of the sastra, one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the Supreme.</p>
<p>After finishing this dedication, one must offer a prayer to the eight-armed Lord Visnu, who sits on the shoulders of Garudadeva.</p>
<p>One also has to think of the fish incarnation, Vamana, Kurma, Nrsimha, Varaha.</p>
<p>Parasurama, Ramacandra (the elder brother of Laksmana).</p>
<p>Nara-Narayana, Dattatreya (an empowered incarnation), Kapila, Sanat-kumara, Hayagriva, Naradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee).</p>
<p>Dhanvantari, Rsabhadeva, Yajna, Balarama, Vyasadeva, Buddhadeva and Kesava.</p>
<p>One should also think of Govinda, the master of Vrndavana and one should think of Narayana, the master of the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>One should think of Madhusudana, Tridhama, Madhava, Hrsikesa, Padmanabha, Janardana, Damodara and Visvesvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>After offering prayers to the Lord’s personal expansions known as the svamsa and saktyavesa-avataras, one should pray to the weapons of Lord Narayana, such as the Sudarsana, gada, sankha, khadga and bow.</p>
<p>After explaining this process, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit how Visvarupa, the brother of Vrtrasura, described the glories of the Narayana-kavaca to Indra.</p>

<p>May the Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Vyasadeva protect me from all kinds of ignorance resulting from the absence of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>May Lord Buddhadeva protect me from activities opposed to Vedic principles and from laziness that causes one to madly forget the Vedic principles of knowledge and ritualistic action.</p>
<p>May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as an incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the dirt of the age of Kali.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appear for various purposes.</p>
<p>Srila Vyasadeva, Mahamuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human society.</p>
<p>If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this age of Kali, one may consult the books left by Srila Vyasadeva, Upanisads, Vedanta-sutra (Brahma-sutra), Mahabharata, Srimad-Bhagavatam Maha-Purana (Vyasadeva’s commentary on the Brahma-sutra) and the other seventeen Puranas.</p>
<p>Only by the mercy of Srila Vyasadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance.</p>
<p>As described by Srila Jayadeva Gosvami in his Dasavatara-stotra, Lord Buddha apparently decried the Vedic knowledge:</p>
<p>nindasi yajna-vidher ahaha sruti-jatam</p>
<p>sadaya-hrdaya-darsita-pasu-ghatam</p>
<p>kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare</p>
<p>The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable activity of animal killing and to save the poor animals from being unnecessarily killed.</p>
<p>When pasandis were cheating by killing animals on the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic yajnas, the Lord said, If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I do not accept the Vedic principles Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic principles.</p>
<p>One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the injunctions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The Kalki avatara is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of the atheists born in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real religious principles enunciated by Lord Krsna before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>Every day they manufacture a new type of dharma on the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation.</p>
<p>Atheistic men generally say, yata mata tata patha.</p>
<p>According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle.</p>
<p>This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the Vedas, and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga progresses.</p>
<p>In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Kesava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.</p>

<p>In the spiritual world, nothing is material.</p>
<p>The sword, bow, club, disc and everything decorating the personal body of the Lord are spiritual living force.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entities, the material energy, the spiritual energy and the entire creation are all individual substances.</p>
<p>In the ultimate analysis, however, together they constitute the supreme one, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge see unity in diversity.</p>
<p>For such advanced persons, the Lord’s bodily decorations, His name, His fame, His attributes and forms and the weapons in His hand are manifestations of the strength of His potency.</p>
<p>According to their elevated spiritual understanding, the omniscient Lord, who manifests various forms, is present everywhere.</p>
<p>May He always protect us everywhere from all calamities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing exists but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4) where Lord Krsna says, maya tatam idam sarvam, indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy.</p>
<p>Visnu Purana (1.22.52):</p>
<p>ekadesa-sthitasyagner</p>
<p>jyotsna vistarini yatha</p>
<p>parasya brahmanah saktis</p>
<p>tathedam akhilam jagat</p>
<p>As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies.</p>
<p>Since both cause and effect are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect.</p>
<p>Consequently the ornaments and weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in the Padma Purana:</p>
<p>nama cintamanih krsnas</p>
<p>caitanya-rasa-vigrahah</p>
<p>purnah suddho nitya-mukto</p>
<p>’bhinnatvan nama-naminoh</p>
<p>The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially.</p>
<p>The word purna means complete The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material contamination.</p>
<p>The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as the Lord.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him.</p>
<p>Therefore even worship of the Lord’s weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>Mayavadis refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is maya, or false, but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Although the Lord’s original form and His impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally.</p>
<p>Therefore this prayer says, patu sarvaih svarupair nah sada sarvatra sama-gah: May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His various forms, protect us everywhere The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form, qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya explains this as follows:</p>
<p>eka eva paro visnur</p>
<p>bhusaheti dhvajesv ajah</p>
<p>tat-tac-chakti-pradatvena</p>
<p>svayam eva vyavasthitah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Indra, who performed one hundred sacrifices, received this prayer of protection from Visvarupa.</p>
<p>After conquering the demons, he enjoyed all the opulences of the three worlds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This mystical mantric armor given by Visvarupa to Indra, the King of heaven, acted powerfully, with the effect that Indra was able to conquer the asuras and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without impediments.</p>
<p>In this regard, Madhvacarya points out:</p>
<p>vidyah karmani ca sada</p>
<p>guroh praptah phala-pradah</p>
<p>anyatha naiva phaladah</p>
<p>prasannoktah phala-pradah</p>
<p>One must receive all kinds of mantras from a bona fide spiritual master; otherwise the mantras will not be fruitful.</p>
<p>This is also indicated in Bhagavad-gita (4.34):</p>
<p>tad viddhi pranipatena</p>
<p>pariprasnena sevaya</p>
<p>upadeksyanti te jnanam</p>
<p>jnaninas tattva-darsinah</p>
<p>Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth All mantras should be received through the authorized guru, and the disciple must satisfy the guru in all respects, after surrendering at his lotus feet.</p>
<p>In the Padma Purana it is also said, sampradaya-vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah.</p>
<p>There are four sampradayas, or disciplic successions, namely the Brahma-sampradaya, the Rudra-sampradaya, the Sri sampradaya and the Kumara-sampradaya.</p>
<p>If one wants to advance in spiritual power, one must receive his mantras from one of these bona fide sampradayas; otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life.</p>
