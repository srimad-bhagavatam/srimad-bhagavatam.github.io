<h1><a class="header" href="#the-nārāyaṇa-kavaca-shield" id="the-nārāyaṇa-kavaca-shield">The Nārāyaṇa-kavaca Shield</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#68" id="68">6.8</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, was victorious over the soldiers of the demons, and it also describes the shield of the Visnu mantra.</p>
<p>To take protection from this shield, one must first touch kusa grass and wash one’s mouth with acamana-mantras.</p>
<p>One should observe silence and then place the eight-syllable Visnu mantra on the parts of his body and place the twelve-syllable mantra on his hands.</p>
<p>The eight-syllable mantra is om namo narayanaya.</p>
<p>This mantra should be distributed all over the front and back of the body.</p>
<p>The twelve-syllable mantra, which begins with the pranava, omkara, is om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.</p>
<p>One syllable should be placed on each of the fingers and should be preceded by the pranava, omkara.</p>
<p>Thereafter, one must chant om visnave namah, which is a six-syllable mantra.</p>
<p>One must progressively place the syllables of the mantra on the heart, the head, between the two eyebrows, on the sikha and between the eyes, and then one should chant mah astraya phat and with this mantra protect himself from all directions.</p>
<p>Nadevo devam arcayet: one who has not risen to the level of a deva cannot chant this mantra.</p>
<p>According to this direction of the sastra, one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the Supreme.</p>
<p>After finishing this dedication, one must offer a prayer to the eight-armed Lord Visnu, who sits on the shoulders of Garudadeva.</p>
<p>One also has to think of the fish incarnation, Vamana, Kurma, Nrsimha, Varaha.</p>
<p>Parasurama, Ramacandra (the elder brother of Laksmana).</p>
<p>Nara-Narayana, Dattatreya (an empowered incarnation), Kapila, Sanat-kumara, Hayagriva, Naradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee).</p>
<p>Dhanvantari, Rsabhadeva, Yajna, Balarama, Vyasadeva, Buddhadeva and Kesava.</p>
<p>One should also think of Govinda, the master of Vrndavana and one should think of Narayana, the master of the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>One should think of Madhusudana, Tridhama, Madhava, Hrsikesa, Padmanabha, Janardana, Damodara and Visvesvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>After offering prayers to the Lord’s personal expansions known as the svamsa and saktyavesa-avataras, one should pray to the weapons of Lord Narayana, such as the Sudarsana, gada, sankha, khadga and bow.</p>
<p>After explaining this process, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit how Visvarupa, the brother of Vrtrasura, described the glories of the Narayana-kavaca to Indra.</p>
