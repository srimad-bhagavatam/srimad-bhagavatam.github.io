<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#65" id="65">6.5</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter relates how all the sons of Daksa were delivered from the clutches of the material energy by following the advice of Narada, who was therefore cursed by Daksa.</p>
<p>Influenced by the external energy of Lord Visnu, Prajapati Daksa begot ten thousand sons in the womb of his wife, Pancajani.</p>
<p>These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the Haryasvas.</p>
<p>Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Haryasvas went west to the place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>In those days this was the site of a holy lake named Narayana-saras, where there were many saintly persons.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas began practicing austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of life.</p>
<p>However, when Srila Narada Muni saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency.</p>
<p>Narada Muni described to the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary karmis to beget children.</p>
<p>Thus all the sons of Daksa became enlightened and left, never to return.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa, who was very sad at the loss of his sons, begot one thousand more sons in the womb of his wife, Pancajani, and ordered them to increase progeny.</p>
<p>These sons, who were named the Savalasvas, also engaged in worshiping Lord Visnu to beget children, but Narada Muni convinced them to become mendicants and not beget children.</p>
<p>Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, Prajapati Daksa became most angry at Narada Muni and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay anywhere.</p>
<p>Since Narada Muni, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Daksa’s curse.</p>
