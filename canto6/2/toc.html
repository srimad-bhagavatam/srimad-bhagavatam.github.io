<h1><a class="header" href="#ajamila-delivered-by-the-visnudutas" id="ajamila-delivered-by-the-visnudutas">Ajamila Delivered by the Visnudutas</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#62" id="62">6.2</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the messengers from Vaikuntha explain to the Yamadutas the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas said, Now impious acts are being performed even in an assembly of devotees, for a person who is not punishable is going to be punished in the assembly of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>The mass of people are helpless and must depend upon the government for their safety and security, but if the government takes advantage of this to harm the citizens, where will they go? We see perfectly that Ajamila should not be punished, although you are attempting to take him to Yamaraja for punishment It was due to Ajamila’s glorifying the holy name of the Supreme Lord that he was not punishable.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas explained this as follows: Simply by once chanting the holy name of Narayana, this brahmana has become free from the reactions of sinful life.</p>
<p>Indeed, he has been freed not only from the sins of this life, but from the sins of many, many thousands of other lives.</p>
<p>He has already undergone true atonement for all his sinful actions.</p>
<p>If one atones according to the directions of the sastras, one does not actually become free from sinful reactions, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, even a glimpse of such chanting can immediately free one from all sins.</p>
<p>Chanting the glories of the Lord’s holy name awakens all good fortune.</p>
<p>Therefore there is no doubt that Ajamila, being completely free from all sinful reactions, should not be punished by Yamaraja As they were saying this, the Visnudutas released Ajamila from the ropes of the Yamadutas and left for their own abode.</p>
<p>The brahmana Ajamila, however, offered his respectful obeisances to the Visnudutas.</p>
<p>He could understand how fortunate he was to have chanted the holy name of Narayana at the end of his life.</p>
<p>Indeed, he could realize the full significance of this good fortune.</p>
<p>Having thoroughly understood the discussion between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, he became a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He lamented very much for how very sinful he had been, and he condemned himself again and again.</p>
<p>Finally, because of his association with the Visnudutas, Ajamila, his original consciousness aroused, gave up everything and went to Hardwar, where he engaged in devotional service without deviation, always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus the Visnudutas went there, seated him on a golden throne and took him away to Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>In summary, although the sinful Ajamila meant to call his son, the holy name of Lord Narayana, even though chanted in the preliminary stage, namabhasa, was able to give him liberation.</p>
<p>Therefore one who chants the holy name of the Lord with faith and devotion is certainly exalted.</p>
<p>He is protected even in his material, conditional life.</p>
