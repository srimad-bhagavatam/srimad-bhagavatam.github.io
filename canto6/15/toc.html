<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#615" id="615">6.15</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, Angira Rsi, along with Narada, consoles Citraketu as far as possible.</p>
<p>Angira and Narada Rsi came to relieve the King from excessive lamentation by instructing him about the spiritual significance of life.</p>
<p>The great saints Angira and Narada explained that the relationship between father and son is not factual; it is simply a representation of the illusory energy.</p>
<p>The relationship did not exist before, nor will it stay in the future.</p>
<p>By the arrangement of time, the relationship exists only in the present.</p>
<p>One should not lament for temporary relationships.</p>
<p>The entire cosmic manifestation is temporary; although not unreal, it is not factual.</p>
<p>By the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything created in the material world is transient.</p>
<p>By a temporary arrangement, a father begets a child, or a living entity becomes the child of a so-called father.</p>
<p>This temporary arrangement is made by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Neither the father nor the son exists independently.</p>
<p>As the King listened to the great sages, he was relieved from his false lamentation, and then he inquired about their identity.</p>
<p>The great sages presented who they were and instructed that all sufferings are due to the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>When one understands his spiritual identity and surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual person, one becomes actually happy.</p>
<p>When one searches for happiness in matter, one must certainly lament for bodily relationships.</p>
<p>Self-realization means spiritual realization of one’s relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Such realization ends one’s miserable material life.</p>
