<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>naradah uvaca—Sri Narada said; deva—of all demigods; deva—the demigod; namah—obeisances; te—unto you as; astu—are; bhuta-bhavana—the generator of all living beings; purva-ja—the firstborn; tat vijanihi—please explain that knowledge; yat jnanam—which knowledge; atma-tattva—transcendental; nidarsanam—specifically directs.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Narada Muni asked Brahmaji: O chief amongst the demigods, O firstborn living entity, I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto you.</p>
<p>Please tell me that transcendental knowledge which specifically directs one to the truth of the individual soul and the Supersoul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The perfection of the parampara system, or the path of disciplic succession, is further confirmed.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter it has been established that Brahmaji, the firstborn living entity, received knowledge directly from the Supreme Lord, and the same knowledge was imparted to Narada, the next disciple.</p>
<p>Narada asked to receive the knowledge, and Brahmaji imparted it upon being asked.</p>
<p>Therefore, asking for transcendental knowledge from the right person and receiving it properly is the regulation of the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>This process is recommended in the Bhagavad-gita (4.2).</p>
<p>The inquisitive student must approach a qualified spiritual master to receive transcendental knowledge by surrender, submissive inquiries and service.</p>
<p>Knowledge received by submissive inquiries and service is more effective than knowledge received in exchange for money.</p>
<p>A spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from Brahma and Narada has no demand for dollars and cents.</p>
<p>A bona fide student has to satisfy him by sincere service to obtain knowledge of the relation and nature of the individual soul and the Supersoul.</p>
