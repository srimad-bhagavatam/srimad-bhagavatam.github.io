<p><strong><a class="header" href="#21" id="21">2.1</a></strong></p>
<p>om namo bhagavate vasudevaya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>om—O my Lord; namah—my respectful obeisances unto You; bhagavate—unto the Personality of Godhead; vasudevaya—unto Lord Krsna, the son of Vasudeva.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong> O my Lord, the all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vasudevaya means to Krsna, the son of Vasudeva Since by chanting the name of Krsna, Vasudeva, one can achieve all the good results of charity, austerity and penances, it is to be understood that by the chanting of this mantra, om namo bhagavate vasudevaya, the author or the speaker or any one of the readers of Srimad-Bhagavatam is offering respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, Krsna, the reservoir of all pleasure.</p>
<p>In the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the principles of creation are described, and thus the First Canto may be called Creation Similarly, in the Second Canto, the post-creation cosmic manifestation is described.</p>
<p>The different planetary systems are described in the Second Canto as different parts of the universal body of the Lord.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Second Canto may be called The Cosmic Manifestation There are ten chapters in the Second Canto, and in these ten chapters the purpose of Srimad-Bhagavatam and the different symptoms of this purpose are narrated.</p>
<p>The first chapter describes the glories of chanting, and it hints at the process by which the neophyte devotees may perform meditation on the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the first verse, Sukadeva Gosvami replies to the questions of Maharaja Pariksit, who asked him about one’s duties at the point of death.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit was glad to receive Sukadeva Gosvami, and he was proud of being a descendant of Arjuna, the intimate friend of Krsna personally, he was very humble and meek, but he expressed his gladness that Lord Krsna was very kind to his grandfathers, the sons of Pandu, especially his own grandfather, Arjuna.</p>
<p>And because Lord Krsna was always pleased with Maharaja Pariksit’s family, at the verge of Maharaja Pariksit’s death Sukadeva Gosvami was sent to help him in the process of self-realization.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit was a devotee of Lord Krsna from his childhood, so he had natural affection for Krsna.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami could understand his devotion.</p>
<p>Therefore, he welcomed the questions about the King’s duty.</p>
<p>Because the King hinted that worship of Lord Krsna is the ultimate function of every living entity, Sukadeva Gosvami welcomed the suggestion and said, Because you have raised questions about Krsna, your question is most glorious The translation of the first verse is as follows.</p>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#211" id="211">2.1.1</a></strong></p>
<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>variyan esa te prasnah</p>
<p>krto loka-hitam nrpa</p>
<p>atmavit-sammatah pumsam</p>
<p>srotavyadisu yah parah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; variyan—glorious; esah—this; te—your; prasnah—question; krtah—made by you; loka-hitam—beneficial for all men; nrpa—O King; atmavit—transcendentalist; sammatah—approved; pumsam—of all men; srotavya-adisu—in all kinds of hearing; yah—what is; parah—the supreme.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial to all kinds of people.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Even the very question is so nice that it is the best subject matter for hearing.</p>
<p>Simply by such questioning and hearing, one can achieve the highest perfectional stage of life.</p>
<p>Because Lord Krsna is the original Supreme Person, any question about Him is original and perfect.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said that the highest perfection of life is to achieve the transcendental loving service of Krsna.</p>
<p>Because questions and answers about Krsna elevate one to that transcendental position, the questions of Maharaja Pariksit about Krsna philosophy are greatly glorified.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit wanted to absorb his mind completely in Krsna, and such absorption can be effected simply by hearing about the uncommon activities of Krsna.</p>
<p>For instance, in the Bhagavad-gita it is stated that simply by understanding the transcendental nature of Lord Krsna’s appearance, disappearance, and activities, one can immediately return home, back to Godhead, and never come back to this miserable condition of material existence.</p>
<p>It is very auspicious, therefore, to hear always about Krsna.</p>
<p>So Maharaja Pariksit requested Sukadeva Gosvami to narrate the activities of Krsna so that he could engage his mind in Krsna.</p>
<p>The activities of Krsna are nondifferent from Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>As long as one is engaged in hearing such transcendental activities of Krsna, he remains aloof from the conditional life of material existence.</p>
<p>The topics of Lord Krsna are so auspicious that they purify the speaker, the hearer and the inquirer.</p>
<p>They are compared to the Ganges waters, which flow from the toe of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Wherever the Ganges waters go, they purify the land and the person who bathes in them.</p>
<p>Similarly, krsna-katha, or the topics of Krsna, are so pure that wherever they are spoken, the place, the hearer, the inquirer, the speaker and all concerned become purified.</p>
