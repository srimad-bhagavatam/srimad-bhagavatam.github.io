<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead, Kapila, continued: My dear mother, now I shall describe unto you the different categories of the Absolute Truth, knowing which any person can be released from the influence of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, only through devotional service (bhaktya mam abhijanati (Bg.18.55)).</p>
<p>As stated in the Bhagavatam, the object of devotional service is mam, Krsna.</p>
<p>And, as explained in the Caitanya-caritamrta, to understand Krsna means to understand Krsna in His personal form with His internal energy, His external energy, His expansions and His incarnations.</p>
<p>There are many diverse departments of knowledge in understanding Krsna.</p>
<p>Sankhya philosophy is especially meant for persons who are conditioned by this material world.</p>
<p>It is generally understood by the parampara system, or by disciplic succession, to be the science of devotional service.</p>
<p>Preliminary studies of devotional service have already been explained.</p>
<p>Now the analytical study of devotional service will be explained by the Lord, who says that by such an analytical study, one becomes freed from the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The same assertion is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Tato mam tattvato jnatva: by understanding the Lord according to various categories, one can become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>This is also explained here.</p>
<p>By understanding the science of devotional service in Sankhya philosophy, one can become free from the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The eternal self, after becoming freed from the spell of material nature, becomes eligible to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>As long as one has even a slight desire to enjoy or lord it over material nature, there is no chance of his being freed from the influence of nature’s material modes.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead analytically, as explained in the Sankhya system of philosophy by Lord Kapiladeva.</p>
