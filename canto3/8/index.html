<h1>Manifestation of Brahma from Garbhodakasayi Visnu</h1>
<p><strong>3.8.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>sat-sevaniyo bata puru-vamso</p>
<p>yal loka-palo bhagavat-pradhanah</p>
<p>babhuvithehajita-kirti-malam</p>
<p>pade pade nutanayasy abhiksnam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—Sri Maitreya Muni said; sat-sevaniyah—worthy to serve the pure devotees; bata—oh, certainly; puru-vamsah—the descendants of King Puru; yat—because; loka-palah—the kings are; bhagavat-pradhanah—chiefly devoted to the Personality of Godhead; babhuvitha—you are also born; iha—in this; ajita—the Lord, who is unconquerable; kirti-malam—chain of transcendental activities; pade pade—step by step; nutanayasi—becoming newer and newer; abhiksnam—always.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya Muni said to Vidura: The royal dynasty of King Puru is worthy to serve the pure devotees because all the descendants of that family are devoted to the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>You are also born in that family, and it is wonderful that because of your attempt the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are becoming newer and newer at every moment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya thanked Vidura and praised him by reference to his family glories.</p>
<p>The Puru dynasty was full of devotees of the Personality of Godhead and was therefore glorious.</p>
<p>Because they were not attached to impersonal Brahman or to the localized Paramatma but were directly attached to Bhagavan, the Personality of Godhead, they were worthy to render service to the Lord and His pure devotees.</p>
<p>Because Vidura was one of the descendants of that family, naturally he engaged in spreading wide the ever-new glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>Maitreya felt happy to have such glorious company as Vidura.</p>
<p>He considered the company of Vidura most desirable because such association can accelerate one’s dormant propensities for devotional service.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.2</strong></p>
<p>so ’ham nrnam ksulla-sukhaya duhkham</p>
<p>mahad gatanam viramaya tasya</p>
<p>pravartaye bhagavatam puranam</p>
<p>yad aha saksad bhagavan rsibhyah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—that; aham—I; nrnam—of the human being; ksulla—very little; sukhaya—for happiness; duhkham—distress; mahat—great; gatanam—entered into; viramaya—for mitigation; tasya—his; pravartaye—in beginning; bhagavatam—Srimad-Bhagavatam; puranam—Vedic supplement; yat—which; aha—said; saksat—directly; bhagavan—the Personality of Godhead; rsibhyah—unto the sages.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Let me now begin speaking on the Bhagavata Purana, which was directly spoken to the great sages by the Personality of Godhead for the benefit of those who are entangled in extreme miseries for the sake of very little pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The sage Maitreya proposed to speak on Srimad-Bhagavatam because it was especially compiled, and traditionally comes down in the disciplic succession, for the solution of all the problems of human society.</p>
<p>Only one who is fortunate can have the opportunity to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam in the association of pure devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>Under the spell of material energy, the living entities are entrapped in the bondage of many difficulties simply for the sake of a little bit of material happiness.</p>
<p>They engage in fruitive activities, not knowing the implications.</p>
<p>Under the false impression that the body is the self, the living entities foolishly relate to so many false attachments.</p>
<p>They think that they can engage with materialistic paraphernalia forever.</p>
<p>This gross misconception of life is so strong that a person suffers continually, life after life, under the external energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>If one comes in contact with the book Bhagavatam as well as with the devotee bhagavata, who knows what the Bhagavatam is, then such a fortunate man gets out of the material entanglement.</p>
<p>Therefore Sri Maitreya Muni, out of compassion for the suffering men in the world, proposes to speak on the Srimad-Bhagavatam first and last.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.3</strong></p>
<p>asinam urvyam bhagavantam adyam</p>
<p>sankarsanam devam akuntha-sattvam</p>
<p>vivitsavas tattvam atah parasya</p>
<p>kumara-mukhya munayo ’nvaprcchan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>asinam—seated; urvyam—in the bottom of the universe; bhagavantam—unto the Lord; adyam—the original; sankarsanam—Sankarsana; devam—the Personality of Godhead; akuntha-sattvam—undeterred knowledge; vivitsavah—being inquisitive to know; tattvam atah—truth like this; parasya—regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kumara—the boy-saint; mukhyah—headed by; munayah—great sages; anvaprcchan—inquired like this.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Some time ago, being inquisitive to know, Sanat-kumara, the chief of the boy-saints, accompanied by other great sages, inquired exactly like you about the truths regarding Vasudeva, the Supreme, from Lord Sankarsana, who is seated at the bottom of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is in clarification of the statement that the Lord spoke directly on the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>When and unto whom the Bhagavatam was spoken is explained herewith.</p>
<p>Questions similar to those put forward by Vidura were asked by great sages like Sanat-kumara, and Lord Sankarsana, the plenary expansion of the Supreme Lord Vasudeva, answered them.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.4</strong></p>
<p>svam eva dhisnyam bahu manayantam</p>
<p>yad vasudevabhidham amananti</p>
<p>pratyag-dhrtaksambuja-kosam isad</p>
<p>unmilayantam vibudhodayaya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>svam—Himself; eva—thus; dhisnyam—situated; bahu—greatly; manayantam—esteemed; yat—that which; vasudeva—Lord Vasudeva; abhidham—by the name; amananti—acknowledge; pratyak-dhrta-aksa—eyes settled for introspection; ambuja-kosam—lotuslike eye; isat—slightly; unmilayantam—opened; vibudha—of the greatly learned sages; udayaya—for the sake of advancement.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At that time Lord Sankarsana was meditating upon His Supreme Lord, whom the learned esteem as Lord Vasudeva, but for the sake of the advancement of the great learned sages He slightly opened His lotus like eyes and began to speak.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.5</strong></p>
<p>svardhuny-udardraih sva-jata-kalapair</p>
<p>upasprsantas caranopadhanam</p>
<p>padmam yad arcanty ahi-raja-kanyah</p>
<p>sa-prema nana-balibhir vararthah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>svardhuni-uda—by the water of the Ganges; ardraih—being moistened; sva-jata—bunch of hairs; kalapaih—situated on the head; upasprsantah—by so touching; carana-upadhanam—the shelter of His feet; padmam—the lotus shelter; yat—that which; arcanti—worships; ahi-raja—the serpent-king; kanyah—daughters; sa-prema—with great devotion; nana—various; balibhih—paraphernalia; vara-arthah—being desirous of husbands.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sages came from the highest planes down to the lower region through the water of the Ganges, and therefore the hair on their heads was wet.</p>
<p>They touched the lotus feet of the Lord, which are worshiped with various paraphernalia by the daughters of the serpent-king when they desire good husbands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Ganges water flows directly from the lotus feet of Visnu, and its course runs from the highest plane of the universe down to the lowest.</p>
<p>The sages came down from Satyaloka by taking advantage of the flowing water, a process of transportation made possible by the power of mystic yoga.</p>
<p>If a river flows thousands and thousands of miles, a perfect yogi can at once transport himself from one place to another simply by dipping in its water.</p>
<p>The Ganges is the only celestial river which flows throughout the universe, and great sages travel all over the universe via this sacred river.</p>
<p>The statement that their hair was wet indicates that it was directly moistened by the water originating from the lotus feet of Visnu (the Ganges).</p>
<p>Whoever touches the water of the Ganges to his head surely touches the lotus feet of the Lord directly and can become free from all effects of sinful acts.</p>
<p>If after taking a bath in the Ganges or being washed of all sins, a man guards himself against committing further sinful acts, then certainly he is delivered.</p>
<p>But if he again takes up sinful activities, his bath in the Ganges is as good as that of the elephant, who nicely takes his bath in a river but later spoils the whole thing by covering himself with dust on the land.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.6</strong></p>
<p>muhur grnanto vacasanuraga-</p>
<p>skhalat-padenasya krtani taj-jnah</p>
<p>kirita-sahasra-mani-praveka-</p>
<p>pradyotitoddama-phana-sahasram</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>muhuh—again and again; grnantah—glorifying; vacasa—by words; anuraga—with great affection; skhalat-padena—with symmetrical rhythm; asya—of the Lord; krtani—activities; tat-jnah—those who know the pastimes; kirita—helmets; sahasra—thousands; mani-praveka—glowing effulgence of the valuable stones; pradyotita—emanating from; uddama—raised; phana—hoods; sahasram—thousands.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The four Kumaras, headed by Sanat-kumara, who all knew the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, glorified the Lord in rhythmic accents with selected words full of affection and love.</p>
<p>At that time Lord Sankarsana, with His thousands of raised hoods, began to radiate an effulgence from the glowing stones on His head.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is sometimes addressed as uttamasloka, which means one who is worshiped with selected words by devotees A profusion of such selected words comes from a devotee who is fully absorbed in affection and love for the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many instances in which even a small boy who was a great devotee of the Lord could offer excellent prayers in the choicest words for glorification of the pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p>In other words, without the development of fine affection and love, one cannot offer prayers to the Lord very suitably.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.7</strong></p>
<p>proktam kilaitad bhagavattamena</p>
<p>nivrtti-dharmabhirataya tena</p>
<p>sanat-kumaraya sa caha prstah</p>
<p>sankhyayanayanga dhrta-vrataya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>proktam—was said; kila—certainly; etat—this; bhagavattamena—by Lord Sankarsana; nivrtti—renunciation; dharma-abhirataya—unto one who has taken this religious vow; tena—by Him; sanat-kumaraya—unto Sanat-kumara; sah—he; ca—also; aha—said; prstah—when inquired of; sankhyayanaya—unto the great sage Sankhyayana; anga—my dear Vidura; dhrta-vrataya—unto one who has taken such a vow.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Sankarsana thus spoke the purport of Srimad-Bhagavatam to the great sage Sanat-kumara, who had already taken the vow of renunciation.</p>
<p>Sanat-kumara also, in his turn, when inquired of by Sankhyayana Muni, explained Srimad-Bhagavatam as he had heard it from Sankarsana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the way of the parampara system.</p>
<p>Although Sanat-kumara, the well-known great saintly Kumara, was in the perfect stage of life, still he heard the message of Srimad-Bhagavatam from Lord Sankarsana.</p>
<p>Similarly, when he was questioned by Sankhyayana Rsi, he spoke to him the same message he had heard from Lord Sankarsana.</p>
<p>In other words, unless one hears from the proper authority one cannot become a preacher.</p>
<p>In devotional service, therefore, two items out of the nine, namely hearing and chanting, are most important.</p>
<p>Without hearing nicely, one cannot preach the message of Vedic knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.8</strong></p>
<p>sankhyayanah paramahamsya-mukhyo</p>
<p>vivaksamano bhagavad-vibhutih</p>
<p>jagada so ’smad-gurave ’nvitaya</p>
<p>parasarayatha brhaspates ca</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sankhyayanah—the great sage Sankhyayana; paramahamsya-mukhyah—the chief of all transcendentalists; vivaksamanah—while reciting; bhagavat-vibhutih—the glories of the Lord; jagada—explained; sah—he; asmat—of me; gurave—unto the spiritual master; anvitaya—followed; parasaraya—unto the sage Parasara; atha brhaspateh ca—also to Brhaspati.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Sankhyayana was the chief amongst the transcendentalists, and when he was describing the glories of the Lord in terms of Srimad-Bhagavatam, it so happened that my spiritual master, Parasara, and Brhaspati both heard him.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.9</strong></p>
<p>provaca mahyam sa dayalur ukto</p>
<p>munih pulastyena puranam adyam</p>
<p>so ’ham tavaitat kathayami vatsa</p>
<p>sraddhalave nityam anuvrataya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>provaca—said; mahyam—unto me; sah—he; dayaluh—kindhearted; uktah—aforementioned; munih—sage; pulastyena—by the sage Pulastya; puranam adyam—the foremost of all the Puranas; sah aham—that also I; tava—unto you; etat—this; kathayami—shall speak; vatsa—my dear son; sraddhalave—unto one who is faithful; nityam—always; anuvrataya—unto one who is a follower.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Parasara, as aforementioned, being so advised by the great sage Pulastya, spoke unto me the foremost of the Puranas (Bhagavatam).</p>
<p>I shall also describe this before you, my dear son, in terms of my hearing, because you are always my faithful follower.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The great sage of the name Pulastya is the father of all demoniac descendants.</p>
<p>Once upon a time Parasara began a sacrifice in which all the demons were to be burnt to death because his father had been killed and devoured by one of them.</p>
<p>The great sage Vasistha Muni arrived at the sacrifice and requested Parasara to stop the deadly action, and because of Vasistha’s position and respect in the community of sages, Parasara could not deny the request.</p>
<p>Parasara having stopped the sacrifice, Pulastya, the father of the demons, appreciated his brahminical temperament and gave the blessing that in the future he would be a great speaker on the Vedic literatures called the Puranas, the supplements of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Parasara’s action was appreciated by Pulastya because Parasara had forgiven the demons out of his brahminical power of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Parasara was able to demolish all the demons in the sacrifice, but he considered, Demons are so made that they devour living creatures, men and animals, but why on that account should I withdraw my brahminical qualification of forgiveness As the great speaker of the Puranas, Parasara first of all spoke on the Srimad-Bhagavata Purana because it is the foremost of all the Puranas.</p>
<p>Maitreya Muni desired to narrate the same Bhagavatam be had heard from Parasara, and Vidura was qualified to hear it because of his faithfulness and his following the instructions received from superiors.</p>
<p>So Srimad-Bhagavatam was being narrated from time immemorial by the disciplic succession, even before the time of Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>The so-called historians calculate the Puranas to be only a few hundred years old, but factually the Puranas existed from time immemorial, before all historical calculations by the mundaners and speculative philosophers.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.10</strong></p>
<p>udaplutam visvam idam tadasid</p>
<p>yan nidrayamilita-drn nyamilayat</p>
<p>ahindra-talpe ’dhisayana ekah</p>
<p>krta-ksanah svatma-ratau nirihah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>uda—water; aplutam—submerged in; visvam—the three worlds; idam—this; tada—at that time; asit—it so remained; yat—in which; nidraya—in slumber; amilita—closed; drk—eyes; nyamilayat—not completely closed; ahi-indra—the great snake Ananta; talpe—on the bed of; adhisayanah—lying on; ekah—alone; krta-ksanah—being engaged; sva-atma-ratau—enjoying in His internal potency; nirihah—without any part of external energy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At that time when the three worlds were submerged in water, Garbhodakasayi Visnu was alone, lying on His bedstead, the great snake Ananta, and although He appeared to be in slumber in His own internal potency, free from the action of the external energy, His eyes were not completely closed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is eternally enjoying transcendental bliss by His internal potency, whereas the external potency is suspended during the time of the dissolution of the cosmic manifestation.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.11</strong></p>
<p>so ’ntah sarire ’rpita-bhuta-suksmah</p>
<p>kalatmikam saktim udirayanah</p>
<p>uvasa tasmin salile pade sve</p>
<p>yathanalo daruni ruddha-viryah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—the Supreme Lord; antah—within; sarire—in the transcendental body; arpita—kept; bhuta—material elements; suksmah—subtle; kala-atmikam—the form of time; saktim—energy; udirayanah—invigorating; uvasa—resided; tasmin—therein; salile—in the water; pade—in the place; sve—His own; yatha—as much as; analah—fire; daruni—in the fuel wood; ruddha-viryah—submerged strength.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just like the strength of fire within fuel wood, the Lord remained within the water of dissolution, submerging all the living entities in their subtle bodies.</p>
<p>He lay in the self-invigorated energy called kala.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After the three worlds—the upper, lower and middle planeary systems—merged into the water of dissolution, the living entities of all the three worlds remained in their subtle bodies by dint of the energy called kala.</p>
<p>In this dissolution, the gross bodies became unmanifest, but the subtle bodies existed, just like the water of the material creation.</p>
<p>Thus the material energy was not completely wound up, as is the case in the full dissolution of the material world.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.12</strong></p>
<p>catur-yuganam ca sahasram apsu</p>
<p>svapan svayodiritaya sva-saktya</p>
<p>kalakhyayasadita-karma-tantro</p>
<p>lokan apitan dadrse sva-dehe</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>catuh—four; yuganam—of the millenniums; ca—also; sahasram—one thousand; apsu—in the water; svapan—dreaming in sleep; svaya—with His internal potency; udiritaya—for further development; sva-saktya—by His own energy; kala-akhyaya—by the name kala; asadita—being so engaged; karma-tantrah—in the matter of fruitive activities; lokan—the total living entities; apitan—bluish; dadrse—saw it so; sva-dehe—in His own body.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord lay down for four thousand yuga cycles in His internal potency, and by His external energy He appeared to be sleeping within the water.</p>
<p>When the living entities were coming out for further development of their fruitive activities, actuated by the energy called kala-sakti, He saw His transcendental body as bluish.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Visnu Purana, kala-sakti is mentioned as avidya.</p>
<p>The symptom of the influence of the kala-sakti is that one has to work in the material world for fruitive results.</p>
<p>The fruitive workers are described in Bhagavad-gita as mudhas, or foolish.</p>
<p>Such foolish living entities are very enthusiastic to work for some temporary benefit within perpetual bondage.</p>
<p>One thinks himself very clever throughout his life if he is able to leave behind him a great asset of wealth for his children, and to achieve this temporary benefit he takes the risk of all sinful activities, without knowledge that such activities will keep him perpetually bound by the shackles of material bondage.</p>
<p>Due to this polluted mentality and due to material sins, the aggregate combination of living entities appeared to be bluish.</p>
<p>Such an impetus of activity for fruitive result is made possible by the dictation of the external energy of the Lord, kala.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.13</strong></p>
<p>tasyartha-suksmabhinivista-drster</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasya—His; artha—subject; suksma—subtle; abhinivista-drsteh—of one whose attention was fixed; antah-gatah—internal; arthah—purpose; rajasa—by the mode of passion of material nature; taniyan—very subtle; gunena—by the qualities; kala-anugatena—in due course of time; viddhah—agitated; susyan—generating; tada—then; abhidyata—pierced through; nabhi-desat—from the abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The subtle subject matter of creation, on which the Lord’s attention was fixed, was agitated by the material mode of passion, and thus the subtle form of creation pierced through His abdomen.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.14</strong></p>
<p>sa padma-kosah sahasodatisthat</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—that; padma-kosah—bud of a lotus flower; sahasa—suddenly; udatisthat—appeared; kalena—by time; karma—fruitive activities; pratibodhanena—awakening; sva-rocisa—by its own effulgence; tat—that; salilam—water of devastation; visalam—vast; vidyotayan—illuminating; arkah—the sun; iva—like; atma-yonih—generating from the Personality of Visnu.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Piercing through, this sum total form of the fruitive activity of the living entities took the shape of the bud of a lotus flower generated from the Personality of Visnu, and by His supreme will it illuminated everything, like the sun, and dried up the vast waters of devastation.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.15</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—that; loka—universal; padmam—lotus flower; sah—He; u—certainly; eva—factually; visnuh—the Lord; pravivisat—entered into; sarva—all; guna-avabhasam—reservoir of all modes of nature; tasmin—in which; svayam—in person; veda-mayah—the personality of Vedic wisdom; vidhata—controller of the universe; svayam-bhuvam—self-born; yam—whom; sma—in the past; vadanti—do say; sah—he; abhut—generated.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Into that universal lotus flower Lord Visnu personally entered as the Supersoul, and when it was thus impregnated with all the modes of material nature, the personality of Vedic wisdom, whom we call the self-born, was generated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This lotus flower is the universal virat form, or the gigantic form of the Lord in the material world.</p>
<p>It becomes amalgamated in the Personality of Godhead Visnu, in His abdomen, at the time of dissolution, and it becomes manifest at the time of creation.</p>
<p>This is due to Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who enters into each of the universes.</p>
<p>In this form is the sum total of all the fruitive activities of the living entities conditioned by material nature, and the first of them, namely Brahma, or the controller of the universe, is generated from this lotus flower.</p>
<p>This first-born living being, unlike all the others, has no material father, and thus he is called self-born, or svayambhu.</p>
<p>He goes to sleep with Narayana at the time of devastation, and when there is another creation, he is born in this way.</p>
<p>From this description we have the conception of three—the gross virat form, the subtle Hiranyagarbha and the material creative force, Brahma.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.16</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasyam—in that; sah—Brahma; ca—and; ambhah—water; ruha-karnikayam—whorl of the lotus; avasthitah—being situated; lokam—the world; apasyamanah—without being able to see; parikraman—circumambulating; vyomni—in space; vivrtta-netrah—while moving the eyes; catvari—four; lebhe—achieved; anudisam—in terms of direction; mukhani—heads.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Brahma, born out of the lotus flower, could not see the world, although he was situated in the whorl.</p>
<p>He therefore circumambulated all of space, and while moving his eyes in all directions he achieved four heads in terms of the four directions.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.17</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasmat—from there; yuga-anta—at the end of the millennium; svasana—the air of devastation; avaghurna—because of movement; jala—water; urmi-cakrat—out of the circle of waves; salilat—from the water; virudham—situated on them; upasritah—having the shelter of; kanjam—lotus flower; u—in astonishment; loka-tattvam—the mystery of creation; na—not; atmanam—himself; addha—perfectly; avidat—could understand; adi-devah—the first demigod.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma, situated in that lotus, could not perfectly understand the creation, the lotus or himself.</p>
<p>At the end of the millennium the air of devastation began to move the water and the lotus in great circular waves.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma was perplexed about his creation, the lotus and the world, even though he tried to understand them for one millennium, which is beyond calculation in the solar years of human beings.</p>
<p>No one, therefore, can know the mystery of the creation and cosmic manifestation simply by mental speculation.</p>
<p>The human being is so limited in his capacity that without the help of the Supreme he can hardly understand the mystery of the will of the Lord in terms of creation, continuance and destruction.</p>

<p>etat kuto vabjam ananyad apsu</p>
<p>asti hy adhastad iha kincanaitad</p>
<p>adhisthitam yatra sata nu bhavyam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kah—who; esah—this; yah asau aham—that I am; abja-prsthe—on top of the lotus; etat—this; kutah—wherefrom; va—either; abjam—lotus flower; ananyat—otherwise; apsu—in the water; asti—there is; hi—certainly; adhastat—from below; iha—in this; kincana—anything; etat—this; adhisthitam—situated; yatra—wherein; sata—automatically; nu—or not; bhavyam—must be.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma, in his ignorance, contemplated: Who am I that am situated on the top of this lotus? Wherefrom has it sprouted? There must be something downwards, and that from which this lotus has grown must be within the water.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The subject matter of the speculations of Brahma in the beginning regarding the creation of the cosmic manifestation is still a subject matter for mental speculators.</p>
<p>The most intelligent man is he who tries to find the cause of his personal existence and that of the whole cosmic creation and thus tries to find the ultimate cause.</p>
<p>If his attempt is properly executed with penances and perseverance, it is sure to be crowned with success.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—he (Brahma); ittham—in this way; udviksya—contemplating; tat—that; abja—lotus; nala—stem; nadibhih—by the pipe; antah-jalam—within the water; avivesa—entered into; na—not; arvak-gatah—in spite of going inside; tat-khara-nala—the stem of the lotus; nala—pipe; nabhim—of the navel; vicinvan—thinking much of it; tat—that; avindata—understood; ajah—the self-born.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma, thus contemplating, entered the water through the channel of the stem of the lotus.</p>
<p>But in spite of entering the stem and going nearer to the navel of Visnu, he could not trace out the root.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By dint of one’s personal endeavor one may go nearer to the Lord, but without the Lord’s mercy one cannot reach the ultimate point.</p>
<p>Such understanding of the Lord is possible only by devotional service, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.55): bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah.</p>

<p>yo deha-bhajam bhayam irayanah</p>
<p>pariksinoty ayur ajasya hetih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tamasi apare—because of an ignorant way of searching; vidura—O Vidura; atma-sargam—the cause of his creation; vicinvatah—while contemplating; abhut—it so became; su-mahan—very great; tri-nemih—time of three dimensions; yah—which; deha-bhajam—of the embodied; bhayam—fearfulness; irayanah—generating; pariksinoti—diminishing the one hundred years; ayuh—duration of life; ajasya—of the self-born; hetih—the wheel of eternal time.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Vidura, while searching in that way about his existence, Brahma reached his ultimate time, which is the eternal wheel in the hand of Visnu and which generates fear in the mind of the living entity like the fear of death.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.21</strong></p>

<p>sanair jita-svasa-nivrtta-citto</p>
<p>nyasidad arudha-samadhi-yogah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatah—thereafter; nivrttah—retired from that endeavor; apratilabdha-kamah—without achievement of the desired destination; sva-dhisnyam—own seat; asadya—reaching; punah—again; sah—he; devah—the demigod; sanaih—without delay; jita-svasa—controlling the breathing; nivrtta—retired; cittah—intelligence; nyasidat—sat down; arudha—in confidence; samadhi-yogah—in meditation on the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, being unable to achieve the desired destination, he retired from such searching and came back again to the top of the lotus.</p>
<p>Thus, controlling all objectives, he concentrated his mind on the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Samadhi involves concentrating the mind upon the supreme cause of all, even if one is unaware of whether His actual nature is personal, impersonal or localized.</p>
<p>Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is certainly a form of devotional service.</p>
<p>To cease from personal sense endeavors and to concentrate on the supreme cause is a sign of self-surrender, and when self-surrender is present, that is a sure sign of devotional service.</p>
<p>Each and every living entity needs to engage in devotional service to the Lord if he wishes to understand the ultimate cause of his existence.</p>



<p><strong>3.8.22</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kalena—in due course of time; sah—he; ajah—the self-born Brahma; purusa-ayusa—by the duration of his age; abhipravrtta—being engaged; yogena—in meditation; virudha—developed; bodhah—intelligence; svayam—automatically; tat antah-hrdaye—in the heart; avabhatam—manifested; apasyata—saw; apasyata—did see; yat—which; na—not; purvam—before.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At the end of Brahma’s one hundred years, when his meditation was complete, he developed the required knowledge, and as a result he could see in his head the Supreme within himself, whom he could not see before with the greatest endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord can be experienced only through the process of devotional service and not by one’s personal endeavor in mental speculation.</p>
<p>The age of Brahma is calculated in terms of divya years, which are distinct from the solar years of human beings.</p>
<p>The divya years are calculated in Bhagavad-gita (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh.</p>
<p>Brahma’s one day is equal to one thousand times the aggregate of the four yugas (calculated to be 4,300,000 years).</p>
<p>On that basis, Brahma meditated for one hundred years before he could understand the supreme cause of all causes, and then he wrote the Brahma-samhita, which is approved and recognized by Lord Caitanya and in which he sings, govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami .</p>
<p>One has to wait for the mercy of the Lord before one can either render service unto Him or know Him as He is.</p>

<p>mrnala—lotus flower; gaura—white all over; ayata—gigantic; sesa-bhoga—body of Sesa-naga; paryanke—on the bed; ekam—alone; purusam—the Supreme Person; sayanam—was lying; phana-atapatra—umbrella of a serpent hood; ayuta—bedecked with; murdha—head; ratna—jewels; dyubhih—by the rays; hata-dhvanta—darkness dissipated; yuga-anta—devastation; toye—in the water.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Brahma could see that on the water there was a gigantic lotuslike white bedstead, the body of Sesa-naga, on which the Personality of Godhead was lying alone.</p>
<p>The whole atmosphere was illuminated by the rays of the jewels bedecking the hood of Sesa-naga, and that illumination dissipated all the darkness of those regions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The luster of the transcendental body of the Lord mocked the beauty of the coral mountain.</p>
<p>The coral mountain is very beautifully dressed by the evening sky, but the yellow dress of the Lord mocked its beauty.</p>
<p>There is gold on the summit of the mountain, but the Lord’s helmet, bedecked with jewels, mocked it.</p>
<p>The mountain’s waterfalls, herbs, etc., with a panorama of flowers, seem like garlands, but the Lord’s gigantic body, and His hands and legs, decorated with jewels, pearls, tulasi leaves and flower garlands, mocked the scene on the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The panoramic beauty of nature, which strikes one with wonder, may be taken as a perverted reflection of the transcendental body of the Lord.</p>
<p>One who is therefore attracted by the beauty of the Lord is no longer attracted by the beauty of material nature, although he does not minimize its beauty.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.59) it is described that one who is attracted by param, the Supreme, is no longer attracted by anything inferior.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ayamatah—by length; vistaratah—by breadth; sva-mana—by His own measurement; dehena—by the transcendental body; loka-traya—the three (upper, middle and lower) planeary systems; sangrahena—by total absorption; vicitra—variegated; divya—transcendental; abharana-amsukanam—rays of the ornaments; krta-sriya apasrita—beauty created by those dresses and ornaments; vesa—dressed; deham—transcendental body.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>His transcendental body, unlimited in length and breadth, occupied the three planeary systems, upper, middle and lower.</p>
<p>His body was self-illuminated by unparalleled dress and variegatedness and was properly ornamented.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The length and breadth of the transcendental body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead could only be measured by His own measurement because He is all-pervading throughout the complete cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>The beauty of material nature is due to His personal beauty, yet He is always magnificently dressed and ornamented to prove His transcendental variegatedness, which is so important in the advancement of spiritual knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>pumsam—of the human being; sva-kamaya—according to the desire; vivikta-margaih—by the path of devotional service; abhyarcatam—worshiped; kama-dugha-anghri-padmam—the lotus feet of the Lord, which can award all desired fruits; pradarsayantam—while showing them; krpaya—by causeless mercy; nakha—nails; indu—moonlike; mayukha—rays; bhinna—divided; anguli—figures; caru-patram—very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord showed His lotus feet by raising them.</p>
<p>His lotus feet are the source of all awards achieved by devotional service free from material contamination.</p>
<p>Such awards are for those who worship Him in pure devotion.</p>
<p>The splendor of the transcendental rays from His moonlike toenails and fingernails appeared like the petals of a flower.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord fulfills the desires of everyone just as one desires.</p>
<p>Pure devotees are interested in achieving the transcendental service of the Lord, which is nondifferent from Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord is the only desire of the pure devotees, and devotional service is the only spotless process for achieving His favor.</p>
<p>Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) that pure devotional service is jnana-karmady-anavrtam: (Madhya 19.167) pure devotional service is without any tinge of speculative knowledge and fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Such devotional service is able to award the pure devotee the highest result, namely direct association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>According to the Gopala-tapani Upanisad, the Lord showed one of the many thousands of petals of His lotus feet.</p>
<p>It is said: brahmano’sav anavaratam me dhyatah stutah parardhante so ’budhyata gopa-veso me purastat avirbabhuva.</p>
<p>After penetrating for millions of years, Lord Brahma could understand the transcendental form of the Lord as Sri Krsna, in the dress of a cowherd boy, and thus he recorded his experience in the Brahma-samhita in the famous prayer, govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami .</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mukhena—by a gesture of the face; loka-arti-hara—vanquisher of the distress of the devotees; smitena—by smiling; parisphurat—dazzling; kundala—earrings; manditena—decorated with; sonayitena—acknowledging; adhara—of His lips; bimba—reflection; bhasa—rays; pratyarhayantam—reciprocating; su-nasena—by His pleasing nose; su-bhrva—and pleasing eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He also acknowledged the service of the devotees and vanquished their distress by His beautiful smile.</p>
<p>The reflection of His face, decorated with earrings, was so pleasing because it dazzled with the rays from His lips and the beauty of His nose and eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Devotional service to the Lord is very much obliging to Him.</p>
<p>There are many transcendentalists in different fields of spiritual activities, but devotional service to the Lord is unique.</p>
<p>Devotees do not ask anything from the Lord in exchange for their service.</p>
<p>Even the most desirable liberation is refused by devotees, although offered by the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord becomes a kind of debtor to the devotees, and He can only try to repay the devotees, service with His ever-enchanting smile.</p>
<p>The devotees are ever satisfied by the smiling face of the Lord, and they become enlivened.</p>
<p>And by seeing the devotees so enlivened, the Lord Himself is further satisfied.</p>
<p>So there is continuous transcendental competition between the Lord and His devotees by such reciprocation of service and acknowledgement.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kadamba-kinjalka—saffron dust of the kadamba flower; pisanga—dress of the color; vasasa—by clothing; su-alankrtam—well decorated; mekhalaya—by the belt; nitambe—on the waist; harena—by the garland; ca—also; ananta—highly; dhanena—valuable; vatsa—my dear Vidura; srivatsa—of the transcendental marking; vaksah-sthala—on the chest; vallabhena—very pleasing.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my dear Vidura, the Lord’s waist was covered with yellow cloth resembling the saffron dust of the kadamba flower, and it was encircled by a well-decorated belt.</p>
<p>His chest was decorated with the srivatsa marking and a necklace of unlimited value.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As a sandalwood tree is decorated with fragrant flowers and branches, the Lord’s body was decorated with valuable jewels and pearls.</p>
<p>He was the self-situated tree, the Lord of all others in the universe.</p>
<p>And as a sandalwood tree is covered with many snakes, so the Lord’s body was also covered by the hoods of Ananta.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word avyakta-mulam is significant here.</p>
<p>Generally, no one can see the roots of a tree.</p>
<p>But as far as the Lord is concerned, He is the root of Himself because there is no other separate cause of His standing but He Himself.</p>
<p>In the Vedas it is said that the Lord is svasrayasraya; He is His own support, and there is no other support for Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, avyakta means the Supreme Lord Himself and no one else.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Like a great mountain, the Lord stands as the abode for all moving and nonmoving living entities.</p>
<p>He is the friend of the snakes because Lord Ananta is His friend.</p>
<p>As a mountain has thousands of golden peas, so the Lord was seen with the thousands of golden-helmeted hoods of Ananta-naga; and as a mountain is sometimes filled with jewels, so also His transcendental body was fully decorated with valuable jewels.</p>
<p>As a mountains is sometimes submerged in the ocean water, so the Lord is sometimes submerged in the water of devastation.</p>

<p>He saw that the garland of flowers on His chest glorified Him with Vedic wisdom in sweet songs and looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>He was protected by the Sudarsana wheel for fighting, and even the sun, moon, air, fire, etc., could not have access to Him.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tarhi—therefore; eva—certainly; tat—His; nabhi—navel; sarah—lake; sarojam—lotus flower; atmanam—Brahma; ambhah—the devastating water; svasanam—the drying air; viyat—the sky; ca—also; dadarsa—looked upon; devah—demigod; jagatah—of the universe; vidhata—maker of the destination; na—not; atah param—beyond; loka-visarga—creation of the cosmic manifestation; drstih—glance.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Brahma, the maker of the universal destination, thus saw the Lord, be simultaneously glanced over creation.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma saw the lake in Lord Visnu’s navel, and the lotus flower, as well as the devastating water, the drying air and the sky.</p>
<p>All became visible to him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma, thus being surcharged with the mode of passion, became inclined to create, and after seeing the five causes of creation indicated by the Personality of Godhead, he began to offer his respectful prayers on the path of the creative mentality.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Even if one is in the material mode of passion, to create something in the world he has to take shelter of the Supreme for the necessary energy.</p>
<p>That is the path of the successful termination of any attempt.</p>
