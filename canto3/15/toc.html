<p>para-tejo-hanam ditih</p>
<p>dadhara varsani satam</p>
<p>sankamana surardanat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—the sage Maitreya said; prajapatyam—of the great Prajapati; tu—but; tat tejah—his powerful semen; para-tejah—others’ prowess; hanam—troubling; ditih—Diti (Kasyapa’s wife); dadhara—bore; varsani—years; satam—hundred; sankamana—being doubtful; sura-ardanat—disturbing to the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, Diti, the wife of the sage Kasyapa, could understand that the sons within her womb would be a cause of disturbance to the demigods.</p>
<p>As such, she continuously bore the powerful semen of Kasyapa Muni, which was meant to give trouble to others, for one hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Sri Maitreya was explaining to Vidura the activities of the demigods, including Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>When Diti heard from her husband that the sons she bore within her abdomen would be causes of disturbances to the demigods, she was not very happy.</p>
<p>There are two classes of men—devotees and nondevotees.</p>
<p>Nondevotees are called demons, and devotees are called demigods.</p>
<p>No sane man or woman can tolerate the nondevotees’ giving trouble to devotees.</p>
<p>Diti, therefore, was reluctant to give birth to her babies; she waited for one hundred years so that at least she could save the demigods from the disturbance for that period.</p>
