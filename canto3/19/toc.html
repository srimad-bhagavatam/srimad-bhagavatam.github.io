<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Maitreya said: After hearing the words of Brahma, the creator, which were free from all sinful purposes and as sweet as nectar, the Lord heartily laughed and accepted his prayer with a glance laden with love.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word nirvyalika is very significant.</p>
<p>The prayers of the demigods or devotees of the Lord are free from all sinful purposes, but the prayers of demons are always filled with sinful purposes.</p>
<p>The demon Hiranyaksa became powerful by deriving a boon from Brahma, and after attaining that boon he created a disturbance because of his sinful intentions.</p>
<p>The prayers of Brahma and other demigods are not to be compared to the prayers of the demons.</p>
<p>Their purpose is to please the Supreme Lord; therefore the Lord smiled and accepted the prayer to kill the demon.</p>
<p>Demons, who are never interested in praising the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they have no information of Him, go to the demigods, and in Bhagavad-gita this is condemned.</p>
<p>Persons who go to the demigods and pray for advancement in sinful activities are considered to be bereft of all intelligence.</p>
<p>Demons have lost all intelligence because they do not know what is actually their self-interest.</p>
<p>Even if they have information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they decline to approach Him; it is not possible for them to get their desired boons from the Supreme Lord because their purposes are always sinful.</p>
<p>It is said that the dacoits in Bengal used to worship the goddess Kali for fulfillment of their sinful desires to plunder others’ property, but they never went to a Visnu temple because they might have been unsuccessful in praying to Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore the prayers of the demigods or the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are always untinged by sinful purposes.</p>
