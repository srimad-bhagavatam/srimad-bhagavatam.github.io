<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maitreya continued: The proud and falsely glorious Daitya paid little heed to the words of Varuna.</p>
<p>O dear Vidura, he learned from Narada the whereabouts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and hurriedly betook himself to the depths of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Materialistic warmongers are not even afraid to fight with their mightiest enemy, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The demon was very encouraged to learn from Varuna that there was one fighter who could actually combat him, and he was very enthusiastic to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to give Him a fight, even though it was predicted by Varuna that by fighting with Visnu he would become prey for dogs, jackals and vultures.</p>
<p>Since demoniac persons are less intelligent, they dare to fight with Visnu, who is known as Ajita, or one who has never been conquered.</p>
