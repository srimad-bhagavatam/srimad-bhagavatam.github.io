<h1>Calculation of Time, from the Atom</h1>
<p><strong>3.11.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>caramah sad-visesanam</p>
<p>aneko ’samyutah sada</p>
<p>paramanuh sa vijneyo</p>
<p>nrnam aikya-bhramo yatah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—Maitreya said; caramah—ultimate; sat—effect; visesanam—symptoms; anekah—innumerable; asamyutah—unmixed; sada—always; parama-anuh—atoms; sah—that; vijneyah—should be understood; nrnam—of men; aikya—oneness; bhramah—mistaken; yatah—from which.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The material manifestation’s ultimate particle, which is indivisible and not formed into a body, is called the atom.</p>
<p>It exists always as an invisible identity, even after the dissolution of all forms.</p>
<p>The material body is but a combination of such atoms, but it is misunderstood by the common man.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The atomic description of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is almost the same as the modern science of atomism, and this is further described in the Paramanu-vada of Kanada.</p>
<p>In modern science also, the atom is accepted as the ultimate indivisible particle of which the universe is composed.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is the full text of all descriptions of knowledge, including the theory of atomism.</p>
<p>The atom is the minute subtle form of eternal time.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.2</strong></p>
<p>sata eva padarthasya</p>
<p>svarupavasthitasya yat</p>
<p>kaivalyam parama-mahan</p>
<p>aviseso nirantarah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>satah—of the effective manifestation; eva—certainly; pada-arthasya—of physical bodies; svarupa-avasthitasya—staying in the same form even to the time of dissolution; yat—that which; kaivalyam—oneness; parama—the supreme; mahan—unlimited; avisesah—forms; nirantarah—eternally.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Atoms are the ultimate state of the manifest universe.</p>
<p>When they stay in their own forms without forming different bodies, they are called the unlimited oneness.</p>
<p>There are certainly different bodies in physical forms, but the atoms themselves form the complete manifestation.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.3</strong></p>
<p>evam kalo ’py anumitah</p>
<p>sauksmye sthaulye ca sattama</p>
<p>samsthana-bhuktya bhagavan</p>
<p>avyakto vyakta-bhug vibhuh</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>evam—thus; kalah—time; api—also; anumitah—measured; sauksmye—in the subtle; sthaulye—in the gross forms; ca—also; sattama—O best; samsthana—combinations of the atoms; bhuktya—by the motion; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; avyaktah—unmanifested; vyakta-bhuk—controlling all physical movement; vibhuh—the great potential.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One can estimate time by measuring the movement of the atomic combination of bodies.</p>
<p>Time is the potency of the almighty Personality of Godhead, Hari, who controls all physical movement although He is not visible in the physical world.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.4</strong></p>
<p>sa kalah paramanur vai</p>
<p>yo bhunkte paramanutam</p>
<p>sato ’visesa-bhug yas tu</p>
<p>sa kalah paramo mahan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—that; kalah—eternal time; parama-anuh—atomic; vai—certainly; yah—which; bhunkte—passes through; parama-anutam—the space of an atom; satah—of the entire aggregate; avisesa-bhuk—passing through the nondual exhibition; yah tu—which; sah—that; kalah—time; paramah—the supreme; mahan—the great.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Atomic time is measured according to its covering a particular atomic space.</p>
<p>That time which covers the unmanifest aggregate of atoms is called the great time.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Time and space are two correlative terms.</p>
<p>Time is measured in terms of its covering a certain space of atoms.</p>
<p>Standard time is calculated in terms of the movement of the sun.</p>
<p>The time covered by the sun in passing over an atom is calculated as atomic time.</p>
<p>The greatest time of all covers the entire existence of the nondual manifestation.</p>
<p>All the planes rotate and cover space, and space is calculated in terms of atoms.</p>
<p>Each plane has its particular orbit for rotating, in which it moves without deviation, and similarly the sun has its orbit.</p>
<p>The complete calculation of the time of creation, maintenance and dissolution, measured in terms of the circulation of the total planeary systems until the end of creation, is known as the supreme kala.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.5</strong></p>
<p>anur dvau paramanu syat</p>
<p>trasarenus trayah smrtah</p>
<p>jalarka-rasmy-avagatah</p>
<p>kham evanupatann agat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>anuh—double atom; dvau—two; parama-anu—atoms; syat—become; trasarenuh—hexatom; trayah—three; smrtah—considered; jala-arka—of sunshine through the holes of a window screen; rasmi—by the rays; avagatah—can be known; kham eva—towards the sky; anupatan agat—going up.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The division of gross time is calculated as follows: two atoms make one double atom, and three double atoms make one hexatom.</p>
<p>This hexatom is visible in the sunshine which enters through the holes of a window screen.</p>
<p>One can clearly see that the hexatom goes up towards the sky.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The atom is described as an invisible particle, but when six such atoms combine together, they are called a trasarenu, and this is visible in the sunshine pouring through the holes of a window screen.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.6</strong></p>
<p>trasarenu-trikam bhunkte</p>
<p>yah kalah sa trutih smrtah</p>
<p>sata-bhagas tu vedhah syat</p>
<p>tais tribhis tu lavah smrtah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>trasarenu-trikam—combination of three hexatoms; bhunkte—as they take time to integrate; yah—that which; kalah—duration of time; sah—that; trutih—by the name truti; smrtah—is called; sata-bhagah—one hundred trutis; tu—but; vedhah—called a vedha; syat—it so happens; taih—by them; tribhih—three times; tu—but; lavah—lava; smrtah—so called.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The time duration needed for the integration of three trasarenus is called a truti, and one hundred trutis make one vedha.</p>
<p>Three vedhas make one lava.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is calculated that if a second is divided into 1687.5 parts, each part is the duration of a truti, which is the time occupied in the integration of eighteen atomic particles.</p>
<p>Such a combination of atoms into different bodies creates the calculation of material time.</p>
<p>The sun is the central point for calculating all different durations.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.7</strong></p>
<p>nimesas tri-lavo jneya</p>
<p>amnatas te trayah ksanah</p>
<p>ksanan panca viduh kastham</p>
<p>laghu ta dasa panca ca</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nimesah—the duration of time called a nimesa; tri-lavah—the duration of three lavas; jneyah—is to be known; amnatah—it is so called; te—they; trayah—three; ksanah—the duration of time called a ksana; ksanan—such ksanas; panca—five; viduh—one should understand; kastham—the duration of time called a kastha; laghu—the duration of time called a laghu; tah—those; dasa panca—fifteen; ca—also.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The duration of time of three lavas is equal to one nimesa, the combination of three nimesas makes one ksana, five ksanas combined together make one kastha, and fifteen kasthas make one laghu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By calculation it is found that one laghu is equal to two minutes.</p>
<p>The atomic calculation of time in terms of Vedic wisdom may be converted into present time with this understanding.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.8</strong></p>
<p>laghuni vai samamnata</p>
<p>dasa panca ca nadika</p>
<p>te dve muhurtah praharah</p>
<p>sad yamah sapta va nrnam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>laghuni—such laghus (each of two minutes); vai—exactly; samamnata—is called; dasa panca—fifteen; ca—also; nadika—a nadika; te—of them; dve—two; muhurtah—a moment; praharah—three hours; sat—six; yamah—one fourth of a day or night; sapta—seven; va—or; nrnam—of human calculation.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Fifteen laghus make one nadika, which is also called a danda.</p>
<p>Two dandas make one muhurta, and six or seven dandas make one fourth of a day or night, according to human calculation.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.9</strong></p>
<p>dvadasardha-palonmanam</p>
<p>caturbhis catur-angulaih</p>
<p>svarna-masaih krta-cchidram</p>
<p>yavat prastha-jala-plutam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>dvadasa-ardha—six; pala—of the scale of weight; unmanam—measuring pot; caturbhih—by weight of four; catuh-angulaih—four fingers by measure; svarna—of gold; masaih—of the weight; krta-chidram—making a hole; yavat—as long as; prastha—measuring one prastha; jala-plutam—filled by water.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The measuring pot for one nadika, or danda, can be prepared with a six-pala-weight (fourteen ounce) pot of copper, in which a hole is bored with a gold probe weighing four masa and measuring four fingers long.</p>
<p>When the pot is placed on water, the time before the water overflows in the pot is called one danda.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is advised herein that the bore in the copper measuring pot must be made with a probe weighing not more than four masa and measuring not longer than four fingers.</p>
<p>This regulates the diameter of the hole.</p>
<p>The pot is submerged in water, and the overflooding time is called a danda.</p>
<p>This is another way of measuring the duration of a danda, just as time is measured by sand in a glass.</p>
<p>It appears that in the days of Vedic civilization there was no dearth of knowledge in physics, chemistry or higher mathematics.</p>
<p>Measurements were calculated in different ways, as simply as could be done.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.10</strong></p>
<p>yamas catvaras catvaro</p>
<p>martyanam ahani ubhe</p>
<p>paksah panca-dasahani</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yamah—three hours; catvarah—four; catvarah—and four; martyanam—of the human beings; ahani—duration of day; ubhe—both day and night; paksah—fortnight; panca-dasa—fifteen; ahani—days; suklah—white; krsnah—black; ca—also; manada—measured.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>It is calculated that there are four praharas, which are also called yamas, in the day and four in the night of the human being.</p>
<p>Similarly, fifteen days and nights are a fortnight, and there are two fortnights, white and black, in a month.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.11</strong></p>
<p>tayoh samuccayo masah</p>
<p>pitrnam tad ahar-nisam</p>
<p>dvau tav rtuh sad ayanam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The aggregate of two fortnights is one month, and that period is one complete day and night for the Pita planes.</p>
<p>Two of such months comprise one season, and six months comprise one complete movement of the sun from south to north.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.12</strong></p>
<p>ayane cahani prahur</p>
<p>vatsaro dvadasa smrtah</p>
<p>samvatsara-satam nrnam</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ayane—in the solar movement (of six months); ca—and; ahani—a day of the demigods; prahuh—it is said; vatsarah—one calendar year; dvadasa—twelve months; smrtah—is so called; samvatsara-satam—one hundred years; nrnam—of human beings; parama-ayuh—duration of life; nirupitam—is estimated.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Two solar movements make one day and night of the demigods, and that combination of day and night is one complete calendar year for the human being.</p>
<p>The human being has a duration of life of one hundred years.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.13</strong></p>
<p>graharksa-tara-cakra-sthah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Influential stars, planes, luminaries and atoms all over the universe are rotating in their respective orbits under the direction of the Supreme, represented by eternal kala.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the sun is the eye of the Supreme and it rotates in its particular orbit of time.</p>
<p>Similarly, beginning from the sun down to the atom, all bodies are under the influence of the kala-cakra, or the orbit of eternal time, and each of them has a scheduled orbital time of one samvatsara.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.14</strong></p>
<p>samvatsarah parivatsara</p>
<p>ida-vatsara eva ca</p>
<p>anuvatsaro vatsaras ca</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There are five different names for the orbits of the sun, moon, stars and luminaries in the firmament, and they each have their own samvatsara.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.52) affirms this control in this way:</p>
<p>yac-caksur esa savita sakala-grahanam</p>
<p>raja samasta-sura-murtir asesa-tejah</p>
<p>yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time.</p>
<p>The sun is the king of all planeary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light</p>



<p><strong>3.11.15</strong></p>
<p>yah srjya-saktim urudhocchvasayan sva-saktya</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—one who; srjya—of creation; saktim—the seeds; urudha—in various ways; ucchvasayan—invigorating; sva-saktya—by his own energy; pumsah—of the living entity; abhramaya—to dissipate darkness; divi—during the daytime; dhavati—moves; bhuta-bhedah—distinct from all other material form; kala-akhyaya—by the name eternal time; guna-mayam—the material results; kratubhih—by offerings; vitanvan—enlarging; tasmai—unto him; balim—ingredients of offerings; harata—one should offer; vatsara-pancakaya—offerings every five years.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Vidura, the sun enlivens all living entities with his unlimited heat and light.</p>
<p>He diminishes the duration of life of all living entities in order to release them from their illusion of material attachment, and he enlarges the path of elevation to the heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>He thus moves in the firmament with great velocity, and therefore everyone should offer him respects once every five years with all ingredients of worship.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.16</strong></p>
<p>vidura uvaca</p>
<p>pitr-deva-manusyanam</p>
<p>ayuh param idam smrtam</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vidurah uvaca—Vidura said; pitr—the Pita planes; deva—the heavenly planes; manusyanam—and that of the human beings; ayuh—duration of life; param—final; idam—in their own measurement; smrtam—calculated; paresam—of the superior living entities; gatim—duration of life; acaksva—kindly calculate; ye—all those who; syuh—are; kalpat—from the millennium; bahih—outside; vidah—greatly learned.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Vidura said: I now understand the life durations of the residents of the Pita planes and heavenly planes as well as that of the human beings.</p>
<p>Now kindly inform me of the durations of life of those greatly learned living entities who are beyond the range of a kalpa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The partial dissolution of the universe that takes place at the end of Brahma’s day does not affect all the planeary systems.</p>
<p>The planes of highly learned living entities like the sages Sanaka and Bhrgu are not affected by the dissolutions of the millenniums.</p>
<p>All the planes are of different types, and each is controlled by a different kala-cakra, or schedule of eternal time.</p>
<p>The time of the earth plane is not applicable to other, more elevated planes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Vidura herein inquires about the duration of life on other planes.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.17</strong></p>
<p>bhagavan veda kalasya</p>
<p>gatim bhagavato nanu</p>
<p>visvam vicaksate dhira</p>

<p>bhagavan—O spiritually powerful one; veda—you know; kalasya—of the eternal time; gatim—movements; bhagavatah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nanu—as a matter of course; visvam—the whole universe; vicaksate—see; dhirah—those who are self-realized; yoga-raddhena—by dint of mystic vision; caksusa—by the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O spiritually powerful one, you can understand the movements of eternal time, which is the controlling form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because you are a self-realized person, you can see everything by the power of mystic vision.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who have reached the highest perfectional stage of mystic power and can see everything in the past, present and future are called tri-kala-jnas.</p>
<p>Similarly, the devotees of the Lord can see everything clearly that is in the revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>The devotees of Lord Sri Krsna can very easily understand the science of Krsna, as well as the situation of the material and spiritual creations, without difficulty.</p>
<p>Devotees do not have to endeavor for any yoga-siddhi, or perfection in mystic powers.</p>
<p>They are competent to understand everything by the grace of the Lord, who is sitting in everyone’s heart.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.18</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maitreya said: O Vidura, the four millenniums are called the Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali yugas.</p>
<p>The aggregate number of years of all of these combined is equal to twelve thousand years of the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The years of the demigods are equal to 360 years of humankind.</p>
<p>As will be clarified in the subsequent verses, 12,000 of the demigods’ years, including the transitional periods which are called yuga-sandhyas, comprise the total of the aforementioned four millenniums.</p>
<p>Thus the aggregate of the above-mentioned four millenniums is 4,320,000 years.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.19</strong></p>
<p>catvari trini dve caikam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The duration of the Satya millennium equals 4,800 years of the years of the demigods; the duration of the Dvapara millennium equals 2,400 years; and that of the Kali millennium is 1,200 years of the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As aforementioned, one year of the demigods is equal to 360 years of the human beings.</p>
<p>The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 x 360, or 1,728,000 years.</p>
<p>The duration of the Treta-yuga is 3,600 x 360, or 1,296,000 years.</p>
<p>The duration of the Dvapara-yuga is 2,400 x 360, or 864,000 years.</p>
<p>And the last, the Kali-yuga, is 1,200 x 360, or 432,000 years.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The transitional periods before and after every millennium, which are a few hundred years as aforementioned, are known as yuga-sandhyas, or the conjunctions of two millenniums, according to the expert astronomers.</p>
<p>In those periods all kinds of religious activities are performed.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Vidura, in the Satya millennium mankind properly and completely maintained the principles of religion, but in other millenniums religion gradually decreased by one part as irreligion was proportionately admitted.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Satya millennium, complete execution of religious principles prevailed.</p>
<p>Gradually, the principles of religion decreased by one part in each of the subsequent millenniums.</p>
<p>In other words, at present there is one part religion and three parts irreligion.</p>
<p>Therefore people in this age are not very happy.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Outside of the three planeary systems (Svarga, Martya and Patala), the four yugas multiplied by one thousand comprise one day on the planet of Brahma.</p>
<p>A similar period comprises a night of Brahma, in which the creator of the universe goes to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Brahma goes to sleep in his nighttime, the three planeary systems below Brahmaloka are all submerged in the water of devastation.</p>
<p>In his sleeping condition, Brahma dreams about the Garbhodakasayi Visnu and takes instruction from the Lord for the rehabilitation of the devastated area of space.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahma, and each of them has different descendants.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, under the insignificant portion of the mode of darkness, the powerful manifestation of the universe merges in the darkness of night.</p>
<p>By the influence of eternal time, the innumerable living entities remain merged in that dissolution, and everything is silent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is an explanation of the night of Brahma, which is the effect of the influence of time in touch with an insignificant portion of the modes of material nature in darkness.</p>
<p>The dissolution of the three worlds is effected by the incarnation of darkness, Rudra, represented by the fire of eternal time which blazes over the three worlds.</p>
<p>These three worlds are known as Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah (Patala, Martya and Svarga).</p>
<p>The innumerable living entities merge into that dissolution, which appears to be the dropping of the curtain of the scene of the Supreme Lord’s energy, and so everything becomes silent.</p>

<p>It is understood that the glare of the sun and moon disappear from the sphere of the three worlds, but the sun and the moon themselves do not vanish.</p>
<p>They appear in the remaining portion of the universe, which is beyond the sphere of the three worlds.</p>
<p>The portion in dissolution remains without sunrays or moonglow.</p>
<p>It all remains dark and full of water, and there are indefatigable winds, as explained in the following verses.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the devastation all the seas overflow, and hurricane winds blow very violently.</p>
<p>Thus the waves of the seas become ferocious, and in no time at all the three worlds are full of water.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that the blazing fire from the mouth of Sankarsana rages for one hundred years of the demigods, or 36,000 human years.</p>
<p>Then for another 36,000 years there are torrents of rain, accompanied by violent winds and waves, and the seas and oceans overflow.</p>
<p>These reactions of worlds.</p>
<p>People forget all these devastations of the worlds and think themselves happy in the material progress of civilization.</p>
<p>This is called maya, or that which is not</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, lies down in the water on the seat of Ananta, with His eyes closed, and the inhabitants of the Janaloka planes offer their glorious prayers unto the Lord with folded hands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We should not understand the sleeping condition of the Lord to be the same as our sleep.</p>
<p>Here the word yoga-nidra is specifically mentioned, which indicates that the Lord’s sleeping condition is also a manifestation of His internal potency.</p>
<p>Whenever the word yoga is used it should be understood to refer to that which is transcendental.</p>
<p>In the transcendental stage all activities are always present, and they are glorified by prayers of great sages like Bhrgu.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus the process of the exhaustion of the duration of life exists for every one of the living beings, including Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>One’s life endures for only one hundred years, in terms of the times in the different planes.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Every living being lives for one hundred years in terms of the times in different planes for different entities.</p>
<p>These one hundred years of life are not equal in every case.</p>
<p>The longest duration of one hundred years belongs to Brahma, but although the life of Brahma is very long, it expires in the course of time.</p>
<p>Brahma is also afraid of his death, and thus he performs devotional service to the Lord, just to release himself from the clutches of illusory energy.</p>
<p>Animals, of course, have no sense of responsibility, but even humans, who have developed a sense of responsibility, while away their valuable time without engaging in devotional service to the Lord; they live merrily, unafraid of impending death.</p>
<p>This is the madness of human society.</p>
<p>The madman has no responsibility in life.</p>
<p>Similarly, a human being who does not develop a sense of responsibility before he dies is no better than the madman who tries to enjoy material life very happily without concern for the future.</p>
<p>It is necessary that every human being be responsible in preparing himself for the next life, even if he has a duration of life like that of Brahma, the greatest of all living creatures within the universe.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The one hundred years of Brahma’s life are divided into two parts, the first half and the second half.</p>
<p>The first half of the duration of Brahma’s life is already over, and the second half is now current.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The duration of one hundred years in the life of Brahma has already been discussed in many places in this work, and it is described in Bhagavad-gita (8.17) also.</p>
<p>Fifty years of the life of Brahma are already over, and fifty years are yet to be completed; then, for Brahma also, death is inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of the first half of Brahma’s life, there was a millennium called Brahma-kalpa, wherein Lord Brahma appeared.</p>
<p>The birth of the Vedas was simultaneous with Brahma’s birth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Padma Purana (Prabhasa-khanda), in thirty days of Brahma many kalpas take place, such as the Varaha-kalpa and Pitr-kalpa.</p>
<p>Thirty days make one month of Brahma, beginning from the full moon to the disappearance of the moon.</p>
<p>Twelve such months complete one year, and fifty years complete one parardha, or one half the duration of the life of Brahma.</p>
<p>The Sveta-varaha appearance of the Lord is the first birthday of Brahma.</p>
<p>The birth date of Brahma is in the month of March, according to Hindu astronomical calculation.</p>
<p>This statement is reproduced from the explanation of Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The millennium which followed the first Brahma millennium is known as the Padma-kalpa because in that millennium the universal lotus flower grew out of the navel reservoir of water of the Personality of Godhead, Hari.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The millennium following the Brahma-kalpa is known as the Padma-kalpa because the universal lotus grows in that millennium.</p>
<p>The Padma-kalpa is also called the Pitr-kalpa in certain Puranas.</p>

<p>ayam—this; tu—but; kathitah—known as; kalpah—the current millennium; dvitiyasya—of the second half; api—certainly; bharata—O descendant of Bharata; varahah—Varaha; iti—thus; vikhyatah—is celebrated; yatra—in which; asit—appeared; sukarah—hog shape; harih—the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O descendant of Bharata, the first millennium in the second half of the life of Brahma is also known as the Varaha millennium because the Personality of Godhead appeared in that millennium as the hog incarnation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The different millenniums known as the Brahma, Padma and Varaha kalpas appear a little puzzling for the layman.</p>
<p>There are some scholars who think these kalpas to be one and the same.</p>
<p>According to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti, the Brahma-kalpa in the beginning of the first half appears to be the Padma-kalpa.</p>
<p>We can, however, simply abide by the text and understand that the present millennium is in the second half of the duration of the life of Brahma.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kalah—eternal time; ayam—this (as measured by Brahma’s duration of life); dvi-parardha-akhyah—measured by the two halves of Brahma’s life; nimesah—less than a second; upacaryate—is so measured; avyakrtasya—of one who is unchanged; anantasya—of the unlimited; hi—certainly; anadeh—of the beginningless; jagat-atmanah—of the soul of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The duration of the two parts of Brahma’s life, as above mentioned, is calculated to be equal to one nimesa (less than a second) for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unchanging and unlimited and is the cause of all causes of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya has given a considerable description of the time of different dimensions, beginning from the atom up to the duration of the life of Brahma.</p>
<p>Now he attempts to give some idea of the time of the unlimited Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He just gives a hint of His unlimited time by the standard of the life of Brahma.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.48) as follows:</p>
<p>yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya</p>
<p>jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah</p>
<p>visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, whose plenary portion is Maha-Visnu.</p>
<p>All the heads of the innumerable universes (the Brahmas) live only by taking shelter of the time occupied by one of His breaths The impersonalists do not believe in the form of the Lord, and thus they would hardly believe in the Lord’s sleeping.</p>
<p>Their idea is obtained by a poor fund of knowledge; they calculate everything in terms of man’s capacity.</p>
<p>They think that the existence of the Supreme is just the opposite of active human existence; because the human being has senses, the Supreme must be without sense perception; because the human being has a form, the Supreme must be formless; and because the human being sleeps, the Supreme must not sleep.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, does not agree with such impersonalists.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated herein that the Supreme Lord rests in yoga-nidra, as previously discussed.</p>
<p>And because He sleeps, naturally He must breathe, and the Brahma-samhita confirms that within His breathing period innumerable Brahmas take birth and die.</p>
<p>There is complete agreement between Srimad-Bhagavatam and the Brahma-samhita.</p>
<p>Eternal time is never lost along with the life of Brahma.</p>
<p>It continues, but it has no ability to control the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Lord is the controller of time.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world there is undoubtedly time, but it has no control over activities.</p>
<p>Time is unlimited, and the spiritual world is also unlimited, since everything there exists on the absolute plane.</p>



<p><strong>3.11.39</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kalah—the eternal time; ayam—this; parama-anu—atom; adih—beginning from; dvi-parardha—two superdurations of time; antah—to the end; isvarah—controller; na—never; eva—certainly; isitum—to control; prabhuh—capable; bhumnah—of the Supreme; isvarah—controller; dhama-maninam—of those who are body conscious.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Eternal time is certainly the controller of different dimensions, from that of the atom up to the superdivisions of the duration of Brahma’s life; but, nevertheless, it is controlled by the Supreme.</p>
<p>Time can control only those who are body conscious, even up to the Satyaloka or the other higher planes of the universe.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This phenomenal material world is expanded to a diameter of four billion miles, as a combination of eight material elements transformed into sixteen further categories, within and without, as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As explained before, the entire material world is a display of sixteen diversities and eight material elements.</p>
<p>The analytical studies of the material world are the subject matter of Sankhya philosophy.</p>
<p>The first sixteen diversities are the eleven senses and five sense objects, and the eight elements are the gross and subtle matter, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego.</p>
<p>All these combined together are distributed throughout the entire universe, which extends diametrically to four billion miles.</p>
<p>Besides this universe of our experience, there are innumerable other universes.</p>
<p>Some of them are bigger than the present one, and all of them are clustered together under similar material elements as described below.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The layers or elements covering the universes are each ten times thicker than the one before, and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The coverings of the universes are also constituted of the elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether, and each is ten times thicker than the one before.</p>
<p>The first covering of the universe is earth, and it is ten times thicker than the universe itself.</p>
<p>If the universe is four billion miles in size, then the size of the earthly covering of the universe is four billion times ten.</p>
<p>The covering of water is ten times greater than the earthly covering, the covering of fire is ten times greater than the watery covering, the covering of air is ten times greater than that of the fire, the covering of ether is ten times greater still than that of air, and so on.</p>
<p>The universe within the coverings of matter appears to be like an atom in comparison to the coverings, and the number of universes is unknown even to those who can estimate the coverings of the universes.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, is therefore said to be the original cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Thus the spiritual abode of Visnu is eternal without a doubt, and it is also the abode of Maha-Visnu, the origin of all manifestations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Maha-Visnu, who is resting in yoga-nidra on the Causal Ocean and creating innumerable universes by His breathing process, only temporarily appears in the mahat-tattva for the temporary manifestation of the material worlds.</p>
<p>He is a plenary portion of Lord Sri Krsna, and thus although He is nondifferent from Lord Krsna, His formal appearance in the material world as an incarnation is temporary.</p>
<p>The original form of the Personality of Godhead is actually the svarupa, or real form, and He eternally resides in the Vaikuntha world (Visnuloka).</p>
<p>The word mahatmanah is used here to indicate Maha-Visnu, and His real manifestation is Lord Krsna, who is called parama, as confirmed in the Brahma-samhita:</p>
<p>isvarah paramah krsnah</p>
<p>sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah</p>
