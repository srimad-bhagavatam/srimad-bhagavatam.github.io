<h1>Victory of Hiranyaksa Over All the Directions of the Universe</h1>
<p><strong>3.17.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>nisamyatma-bhuva gitam</p>
<p>karanam sankayojjhitah</p>
<p>tatah sarve nyavartanta</p>
<p>tridivaya divaukasah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah—the sage Maitreya; uvaca—said; nisamya—upon hearing; atma-bhuva—by Brahma; gitam—explanation; karanam—the cause; sankaya—from fear; ujjhitah—freed; tatah—then; sarve—all; nyavartanta—returned; tri-divaya—to the heavenly planes; diva-okasah—the demigods (who inhabit the higher planes).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Maitreya said: The demigods, the inhabitants of the higher planes, were freed from all fear upon hearing the cause of the darkness explained by Brahma, who was born from Visnu.</p>
<p>Thus they all returned to their respective planes.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods, who are denizens of higher planes, are also very much afraid of incidents such as the universe’s becoming dark, and so they consulted Brahma.</p>
<p>This indicates that the quality of fear exists for every living entity in the material world.</p>
<p>The four principal activities of material existence are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating.</p>
<p>The fear element exists also in the demigods.</p>
<p>On every plane, even in the higher planeary systems, including the moon and the sun, as well as on this earth, the same principles of animal life exist.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why are the demigods also afraid of the darkness? The difference between the demigods and ordinary human beings is that the demigods approach authority, whereas the inhabitants of this earth defy authority.</p>
<p>If people would only approach the authority, then every adverse condition in this universe could be rectified.</p>
<p>Arjuna was also disturbed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, but he approached the authority, Krsna, and his problem was solved.</p>
<p>The conclusive instruction of this incident is that we may be disturbed by some material condition, but if we approach the authority who can actually explain the matter, then our problem is solved.</p>
<p>The demigods approached Brahma for the meaning of the disturbance, and after hearing from him they were satisfied and returned home peacefully.</p>

<p>ditis tu bhartur adesad</p>
<p>apatya-parisankini</p>

<p>ditih—Diti; tu—but; bhartuh—of her husband; adesat—by the order; apatya—from her children; parisankini—being apprehensive of trouble; purne—full; varsa-sate—after one hundred years; sadhvi—the virtuous lady; putrau—two sons; prasusuve—begot; yamau—twins.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The virtuous lady Diti had been very apprehensive of trouble to the gods from the children in her womb, and her husband predicted the same.</p>
<p>She brought forth twin sons after a full one hundred years of pregnancy.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.3</strong></p>
<p>utpata bahavas tatra</p>
<p>nipetur jayamanayoh</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>On the birth of the two demons there were many natural disturbances, all very fearful and wonderful, in the heavenly planes, the earthly planes and in between them.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.4</strong></p>
<p>sahacala bhuvas celur</p>
<p>disah sarvah prajajvaluh</p>
<p>solkas casanayah petuh</p>
<p>ketavas carti-hetavah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>saha—along with; acalah—the mountains; bhuvah—of the earth; celuh—shook; disah—directions; sarvah—all; prajajvaluh—blazed like fire; sa—with; ulkah—meteors; ca—and; asanayah—thunderbolts; petuh—fell; ketavah—comets; ca—and; arti-hetavah—the cause of all inauspiciousness.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There were earthquakes along the mountains on the earth, and it appeared that there was fire everywhere.</p>
<p>Many inauspicious planes like Saturn appeared, along with comets, meteors and thunderbolts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When natural disturbances occur on a plane, one should understand that a demon must have taken birth there.</p>
<p>In the present age the number of demoniac people is increasing; therefore natural disturbances are also increasing.</p>
<p>There is no doubt about this, as we can understand from the statements of the Bhagavatam.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.5</strong></p>
<p>vavau vayuh suduhsparsah</p>
<p>phut-karan irayan muhuh</p>
<p>unmulayan naga-patin</p>
<p>vatyaniko rajo-dhvajah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There blew winds which were most uninviting to the touch, hissing again and again and uprooting gigantic trees.</p>
<p>They had storms for their armies and clouds of dust for their ensigns.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When there are natural disturbances like blowing cyclones, too much heat or snowfall, and uprooting of trees by hurricanes, it is to be understood that the demoniac population is increasing and so the natural disturbance is also taking place.</p>
<p>There are many countries on the globe, even at the present moment, where all these disturbances are current.</p>
<p>This is true all over the world.</p>
<p>There is insufficient sunshine, and there are always clouds in the sky, snowfall and severe cold.</p>
<p>These assure that such places are inhabited by demoniac people who are accustomed to all kinds of forbidden, sinful activity.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.6</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The ocean with its high waves wailed aloud as if stricken with sorrow, and there was a commotion among the creatures inhabiting the ocean.</p>
<p>The rivers and lakes were also agitated, and lotuses withered.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.8</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Vidura, the asses ran hither and thither in herds, striking the earth with their hard hooves and wildly braying.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Asses also feel very respectable as a race, and when they run in flocks hither and thither in so-called jollity, it is understood to be a bad sign for human society.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.12</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.17.14</strong></p>
<p>grahan punyataman anye</p>
<p>bhaganams capi dipitah</p>
<p>aticerur vakra-gatya</p>
<p>yuyudhus ca parasparam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p>Taking seemingly retrograde courses, the planes came in conflict with one another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The entire universe is moving under the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Those living entities who are in goodness are called the pious species—pious lands, pious trees, etc.</p>
<p>It is similar with the planes also; many planes are considered pious, and others are considered impious.</p>
<p>Saturn and Mars are considered impious.</p>
<p>When the pious planes shine very brightly, it is an auspicious sign, but when the inauspicious planes shine very brightly, this is not a very good sign.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.15</strong></p>
<p>drstvanyams ca mahotpatan</p>
<p>atat-tattva-vidah prajah</p>
<p>brahma-putran rte bhita</p>
<p>menire visva-samplavam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>drstva—having seen; anyan—others; ca—and; maha—great; utpatan—evil omens; a-tat-tattva-vidah—not knowing the secret (of the portents); prajah—people; brahma-putran—the sons of Brahma (the four Kumaras); rte—except; bhitah—being fearful; menire—thought; visva-samplavam—the dissolution of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Marking these and many other omens of evil times, everyone but the four sage-sons of Brahma, who were aware of the fall of Jaya and Vijaya and of their birth as Diti’s sons, was seized with fear.</p>
<p>They did not know the secrets of these portents and thought that the dissolution of the universe was at hand.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter, the laws of nature are so stringent that it is impossible for the living entity to surpass their enforcement.</p>
<p>It is also explained that only those who are fully surrendered to Krsna in Krsna consciousness can be saved.</p>
<p>We can learn from the description of the Srimad-Bhagavatam that it is because of the birth of two great demons that there were so many natural disturbances.</p>
<p>It is to be indirectly understood, as previously described, that when there are constant disturbances on the earth, that is an omen that some demoniac people have been born or that the demoniac population has increased.</p>
<p>In former days there were only two demons—those born of Diti—yet there were so many disturbances.</p>
<p>At the present day, especially in this age of Kali, these disturbances are always visible, which indicates that the demoniac population has certainly increased.</p>
<p>To check the increase of demoniac population, the Vedic civilization enacted so many rules and regulations of social life, the most important of which is the garbhadhana process for begetting good children.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita Arjuna informed Krsna that if there is unwanted population (varna-sankara), the entire world will appear to be hell.</p>
<p>People are very anxious for peace in the world, but there are so many unwanted children born without the benefit of the garbhadhana ceremony, just like the demons born from Diti.</p>
<p>Diti was so lusty that she forced her husband to copulate at a time which was inauspicious, and therefore the demons were born to create disturbances.</p>
<p>In having sex life to beget children, one should observe the process for begetting nice children; if each and every householder in every family observes the Vedic system, then there are nice children, not demons, and automatically there is peace in the world.</p>
<p>If we do not follow regulations in life for social tranquillity, we cannot expect peace.</p>
<p>Rather, we will have to undergo the stringent reactions of natural laws.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.16</strong></p>
<p>tav adi-daityau sahasa</p>
<p>vyajyamanatma-paurusau</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>These two demons who appeared in ancient times soon began to exhibit uncommon bodily features; they had steellike frames which began to grow just like two great mountains.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two classes of men in the world; one is called the demon, and the other is called the demigod.</p>
<p>The demigods concern themselves with the spiritual upliftment of human society, whereas the demons are concerned with physical and material upliftment.</p>
<p>The two demons born of Diti began to make their bodies as strong as iron frames, and they were so tall that they seemed to touch outer space.</p>
<p>They were decorated with valuable ornaments, and they thought that this was success in life.</p>
<p>Originally it was planned that Jaya and Vijaya, the two doorkeepers of Vaikuntha, were to take birth in this material world, where, by the curse of the sages, they were to play the part of always being angry with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As demoniac persons, they became so angry that they were not concerned with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but simply with physical comforts and physical upliftment.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.17</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>divi-sprsau—touching the sky; hema—golden; kirita—of their helmets; kotibhih—with the crests; niruddha—blocked; kasthau—the directions; sphurat—brilliant; angada—bracelets; bhujau—on whose arms; gam—the earth; kampayantau—shaking; caranaih—with their feet; pade pade—at every step; katya—with their waists; su-kancya—with beautiful decorated belts; arkam—the sun; atitya—surpassing; tasthatuh—they stood.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Their bodies became so tall that they seemed to kiss the sky with the crests of their gold crowns.</p>
<p>They blocked the view of all directions and while walking shook the earth at every step.</p>
<p>Their arms were adorned with brilliant bracelets, and they stood as if covering the sun with their waists, which were bound with excellent and beautiful girdles.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the demoniac way of civilization, people are interested in getting a body constructed in such a way that when they walk on the street the earth will tremble and when they stand it will appear that they cover the sun and the vision of the four directions.</p>
<p>If a race appears strong in body, their country is materially considered to be among the highly advanced nations of the world.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.18</strong></p>
<p>prajapatir nama tayor akarsid</p>
<p>yah prak sva-dehad yamayor ajayata</p>
<p>tam vai hiranyakasipum viduh praja</p>
<p>yam tam hiranyaksam asuta sagratah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prajapatih—Kasyapa; nama—names; tayoh—of the two; akarsit—gave; yah—who; prak—first; sva-dehat—from his body; yamayoh—of the twins; ajayata—was delivered; tam—him; vai—indeed; hiranyakasipum—Hiranyakasipu; viduh—know; prajah—people; yam—whom; tam—him; hiranyaksam—Hiranyaksa; asuta—gave birth to; sa—she (Diti); agratah—first.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa, Prajapati, the creator of the living entities, gave his twin sons their names; the one who was born first he named Hiranyaksa, and the one who was first conceived by Diti he named Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is an authoritative Vedic literature called Pinda-siddhi in which the scientific understanding of pregnancy is very nicely described.</p>
<p>It is stated that when the male secretion enters the menstrual flux in the uterus in two successive drops, the mother develops two embryos in her womb, and she brings forth twins in a reverse order to that in which they were first conceived; the child conceived first is born later, and the one conceived later is brought forth first.</p>
<p>The first child conceived in the womb lives behind the second child, so when birth takes place the second child appears first, and the first child appears second.</p>
<p>In this case it is understood that Hiranyaksa, the second child conceived, was delivered first, whereas Hiranyakasipu, the child who was behind him, having been conceived first, was born second.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.19</strong></p>
<p>cakre hiranyakasipur</p>
<p>dorbhyam brahma-varena ca</p>
<p>vase sa-palal lokams trin</p>
<p>akuto-mrtyur uddhatah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>cakre—made; hiranyakasipuh—Hiranyakasipu; dorbhyam—by his two arms; brahma-varena—by the benediction of Brahma; ca—and; vase—under his control; sa-palan—along with their protectors; lokan—the worlds; trin—three; akutah-mrtyuh—fearing death from no one; uddhatah—puffed up.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The elder child, Hiranyakasipu, was unafraid of death from anyone within the three worlds because he received a benediction from Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>He was proud and puffed up due to this benediction and was able to bring all three planeary systems under his control.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As will be revealed in later chapters, Hiranyakasipu underwent severe austerity and penance to satisfy Brahma and thus receive a benediction of immortality.</p>
<p>Actually, it is impossible even for Lord Brahma to give anyone the benediction of becoming immortal, but indirectly Hiranyakasipu received the benediction that no one within this material world would be able to kill him.</p>
<p>In other words, because he originally came from the abode of Vaikuntha, he was not to be killed by anyone within this material world.</p>
<p>The Lord desired to appear Himself to kill him.</p>
<p>One may be very proud of his material advancement in knowledge, but he cannot be immune to the four principles of material existence, namely birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>It was the Lord’s plan to teach people that even Hiranyakasipu, who was so powerful and strongly built, could not live more than his destined duration of life.</p>
<p>One may become as strong and puffed up as Hiranyakasipu and bring under his control all the three worlds, but there is no possibility of continuing life eternally or keeping the conquered booty forever.</p>
<p>So many emperors have ascended to power, and they are now lost in oblivion; that is the history of the world.</p>



<p><strong>3.17.20</strong></p>

<p>priyah priti-krd anvaham</p>
<p>gada-panir divam yato</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>hiranyaksah—Hiranyaksa; anujah—younger brother; tasya—his; priyah—beloved; priti-krt—ready to please; anu-aham—every day; gada-panih—with a club in hand; divam—to the higher planes; yatah—traveled; yuyutsuh—desirous to fight; mrgayan—seeking; ranam—combat.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>His younger brother, Hiranyaksa, was always ready to satisfy his elder brother by his activities.</p>
<p>Hiranyaksa took a club on his shoulder and traveled all over the universe with a fighting spirit just to satisfy Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac spirit is to train all family members to exploit the resources of this universe for personal sense gratification, whereas the godly spirit is to engage everything in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu was himself very powerful, and he made his younger brother, Hiranyaksa, powerful to assist him in fighting with everyone and lording it over material nature as long as possible.</p>
<p>If possible, he wanted to rule the universe eternally.</p>
<p>These are demonstrations of the spirit of the demoniac living entity.</p>

<p>He had anklets of gold tinkling about his feet, he was adorned with a gigantic garland, and he rested his huge mace on one of his shoulders.</p>
