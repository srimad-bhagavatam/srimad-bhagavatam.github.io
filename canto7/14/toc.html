<p><strong><a class="header" href="#714" id="714">7.14</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the occupational duties of the householder according to the time, the country and the performer.</p>
<p>When Yudhisthira Maharaja became very much inquisitive about the occupational duties for the householder, Narada Muni advised him that a grhastha’s first duty is to be fully dependent on Vasudeva, Krsna, and to try to satisfy Him in all respects by executing one’s prescribed devotional service.</p>
<p>This devotional service will depend on the instructions of authorities and the association of devotees who are actually engaged in devotional service.</p>
<p>The beginning of devotional service is sravanam, or hearing.</p>
<p>One must hear from the mouths of realized souls.</p>
<p>In this way the grhastha’s attraction to his wife and children will gradually be reduced.</p>
<p>As for the maintenance of his family, a grhastha, while earning what he requires for his living, must be very conscientious and must not undergo extraordinary endeavor simply to accumulate money and unnecessarily increase in material comforts.</p>
<p>Although a grhastha should externally be very active in earning his livelihood, he should internally be situated as a fully self-realized person, without attachment for material gains.</p>
<p>His dealings with family members or friends should be performed simply to fulfill their purpose; one should not be extravagantly engaged in this way.</p>
<p>Instructions from family members and society should be accepted superficially, but in essence the grhastha should be engaged in occupational duties advised by the spiritual master and sastra.</p>
<p>Specifically a grhastha should engage in agricultural activities to earn money.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam—agriculture, cow protection and trade—are special duties of grhasthas.</p>
<p>If by chance or by the grace of the Lord more money comes, it should be properly engaged for the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>One should not be eager to earn more money simply for sensual pleasure.</p>
<p>A grhastha should always remember that one who is endeavoring to accumulate more money than necessary is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature.</p>
<p>A grhastha should be very much affectionate toward lower animals, birds and bees, treating them exactly like his own children.</p>
<p>A grhastha should not indulge in killing animals or birds for sense gratification.</p>
<p>He should provide the necessities of life even to the dogs and the lowest creatures and should not exploit others for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Factually, according to the instructions of Srimad-Bhagavatam, every grhastha is a great communist who provides the means of living for everyone.</p>
<p>Whatever a grhastha may possess he should equally distribute to all living entities, without discrimination.</p>
<p>The best process is to distribute prasada.</p>
<p>A grhastha should not be very much attached to his wife; he should engage even his own wife in serving a guest with all attention.</p>
<p>Whatever money a grhastha accumulates by the grace of God he should spend in five activities, namely worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, receiving Vaisnavas and saintly persons, distributing prasada to the general public and to all living entities, offering prasada to his forefathers, and also offering prasada to his own self.</p>
<p>Grhasthas should always be ready to worship everyone as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The grhastha should not eat anything not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As it is said in the Bhagavad-gita (3.13), yajna-sistasinah santo mucyante sarva-kilbisaih: The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice The grhastha should also visit the holy places of pilgrimage mentioned in the puranas.</p>
<p>In this way he should fully engage in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the benefit of his family, his society, his country, and humanity at large.</p>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#7141" id="7141">7.14.1</a></strong></p>
<p>sri-yudhisthira uvaca</p>
<p>grhastha etam padavim</p>
<p>vidhina yena canjasa</p>
<p>yayad deva-rse bruhi</p>
<p>madrso grha-mudha-dhih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-yudhisthirah uvaca—Yudhisthira Maharaja said; grhasthah—a person living with his family; etam—this (the process mentioned in the previous chapter); padavim—position of liberation; vidhina—according to the instructions of Vedic scripture; yena—by which; ca—also; anjasa—easily; yayat—may get; deva-rse—O great sage among the demigods; bruhi—kindly explain; madrsah—such as me; grha-mudha-dhih—completely ignorant of the goal of life.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired from Narada Muni: O my lord, O great sage, kindly explain how we who are staying at home without knowledge of the goal of life may also easily attain liberation, according to the instructions of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapters the great sage Narada has explained how a brahmacari, a vanaprastha and a sannyasi should act.</p>
<p>He first explained the dealings of a brahmacari, vanaprastha and sannyasi because these three asramas, or statuses of life, are extremely important for fulfillment of the goal of life.</p>
<p>One should note that in the brahmacari-asrama, vanaprastha-asrama and sannyasa-asrama there is no scope for sex life, whereas sex is allowed in grhastha life under regulations.</p>
<p>Narada Muni, therefore, first described brahmacarya, vanaprastha and sannyasa because he wanted to stress that sex is not at all necessary, although one who absolutely requires it is allowed to enter grhastha life, or household life, which is also regulated by the sastras and guru.</p>
<p>Yudhisthira Maharaja could understand all this.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a grhastha, he presented himself as grha-mudha-dhih, one who is completely ignorant of the goal of life.</p>
<p>A person who remains a householder in family life is certainly ignorant of life’s goal; he is not very much advanced in intelligence.</p>
<p>As soon as possible, one should give up his so-called comfortable life at home and prepare to undergo austerity, or tapasya.</p>
<p>Tapo divyam putraka.</p>
<p>According to the instructions given by Rsabhadeva to His sons, we should not create a so-called comfortable situation, but must prepare to undergo austerity.</p>
<p>This is how a human being should actually live to fulfill life’s ultimate goal.</p>
