<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The saint Narada Muni continued: Although Prahlada Maharaja was only a boy, when he heard the benedictions offered by Lord Nrsimhadeva he considered them impediments on the path of devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he smiled very mildly and spoke as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material achievements are not the ultimate goal of devotional service.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of devotional service is love of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore although Prahlada Maharaja, Dhruva Maharaja, Ambarisa Maharaja, Yudhisthira Maharaja and many devotee kings were materially very opulent, they accepted their material opulence in the service of the Lord, not for their personal sense gratification.</p>
<p>Of course, possessing material opulence is always fearful because under the influence of material opulence one may be misdirected from devotional service.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a pure devotee (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)) is never misdirected by material opulence.</p>
<p>On the contrary, whatever he possesses he engages one hundred percent in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>When one is allured by material possessions, they are considered to be given by maya, but when one uses material possessions fully for service, they are considered God’s gifts, or facilities offered by Krsna for enhancing one’s devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja said: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because I was born in an atheistic family I am naturally attached to material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Therefore, kindly do not tempt me with these illusions.</p>
<p>I am very much afraid of material conditions, and I desire to be liberated from materialistic life.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Materialistic life means attachment to the body and everything in relationship to the body.</p>
<p>This attachment is based on lusty desires for sense gratification, specifically sexual enjoyment.</p>
<p>Kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah: (Bg.7.20) when one is too attached to material enjoyment, he is bereft of all knowledge (hrta jnanah).</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, those who are attached to material enjoyment are mostly inclined to worship the demigods to procure various material opulences.</p>
<p>They are especially attached to worship of the goddess Durga and Lord Siva because this transcendental couple can offer their devotees all material opulence.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja, however, was detached from all material enjoyment.</p>
<p>He therefore took shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nrsimhadeva, and not the feet of any demigod.</p>
<p>It is to be understood that if one really wants release from this material world, from the threefold miseries and from janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi (birth, death, old age and disease), one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for without the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot get release from materialistic life.</p>
<p>Atheistic men are very much attached to material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Therefore if they get some opportunity to achieve more and more material enjoyment, they take it.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja, however, was very careful in this regard.</p>
<p>Although born of a materialistic father, because he was a devotee he had no material desires (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my worshipable Lord, because the seed of lusty desires, which is the root cause of material existence, is within the core of everyone’s heart, You have sent me to this material world to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee.</p>

<p>Nitya-siddha devotees come from Vaikuntha to this material world to teach, by their personal example, how to become a devotee.</p>
<p>The living entities in this material world can take lessons from such nitya-siddha devotees and thus become inclined to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>A nitya-siddha devotee comes from Vaikuntha upon the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and shows by his example how to become a pure devotee (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)).</p>
<p>In spite of coming to this material world, the nitya-siddha devotee is never attracted by the allurements of material enjoyment.</p>
<p>A perfect example is Prahlada Maharaja, who was a nitya-siddha, a maha-bhagavata devotee.</p>
<p>Although Prahlada was born in the family of Hiranyakasipu, an atheist, he was never attached to any kind of materialistic enjoyment.</p>
<p>Desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee, the Lord tried to induce Prahlada Maharaja to take material benedictions, but Prahlada Maharaja did not accept them.</p>
<p>On the contrary, by his personal example he showed the symptoms of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>In other words, the Lord Himself has no desire to send His pure devotee to this material world, nor does a devotee have any material purpose in coming.</p>
<p>When the Lord Himself appears as an incarnation within this material world, He is not allured by the material atmosphere, and He has nothing to do with material activity, yet by His example He teaches the common man how to become a devotee.</p>
<p>Similarly, a devotee who comes here in accordance with the order of the Supreme Lord shows by his personal behavior how to become a pure devotee.</p>
<p>A pure devotee, therefore, is a practical example for all living entities, including Lord Brahma.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; anyatha—otherwise; te—of You; akhila-guro—O supreme instructor of the entire creation; ghateta—such a thing can happen; karuna-atmanah—the Supreme Person, who is extremely kind to His devotees; yah—any person who; te—from You; asisah—material benefits; asaste—desires (in exchange for serving You); na—not; sah—such a person; bhrtyah—a servitor; sah—such a person; vai—indeed; vanik—a merchant (who wants to get material profit from his business).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, O my Lord, O supreme instructor of the entire world, You are so kind to Your devotee that You could not induce him to do something unbeneficial for him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one who desires some material benefit in exchange for devotional service cannot be Your pure devotee.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is no better than a merchant who wants profit in exchange for service.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is sometimes found that one comes to a devotee or a temple of the Lord just to get some material benefit.</p>
<p>Such a person is described here as a mercantile man.Bhagavad-gita speaks of arto jijnasur artharthi.</p>
<p>The word arta refers to one who is physically distressed, and artharthi refers to one in need of money.</p>
<p>Such persons are forced to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for mitigation of their distress or to get some money by the benediction of the Lord.</p>
<p>They have been described as sukrti, pious, because in their distress or need for money they have approached the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Unless one is pious, one cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>However, although a pious man may receive some material benefit, one who is concerned with material benefits cannot be a pure devotee.</p>
<p>When a pure devotee receives material opulences, this is not because of his pious activity but for the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>When one engages in devotional service, one is automatically pious.</p>
<p>Therefore, a pure devotee is anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).</p>
<p>He has no desire for material profit, nor does the Lord induce him to try to profit materially.</p>
<p>When a devotee needs something, the Supreme Personality of Godhead supplies it (yoga-ksemam vahamy aham (Bg.9.22)).</p>
<p>Sometimes materialists go to a temple to offer flowers and fruit to the Lord because they have learned from Bhagavad-gita that if a devotee offers some flowers and fruits, the Lord accepts them.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.26) the Lord says:</p>
<p>patram puspam phalam toyam</p>
<p>yo me bhaktya prayacchati</p>
<p>tad aham bhakty-upahrtam</p>
<p>asnami prayatatmanah</p>
<p>If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it Thus a man with a mercantile mentality thinks that if he can get some material benefit, like a large amount of money, simply by offering a little fruit and flower, this is good business.</p>
<p>Such persons are not accepted as pure devotees.</p>
<p>Because their desires are not purified, they are still mercantile men, even though they go to temples to make a show of being devotees.</p>
<p>Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam: (Cc.Madhya 19.170) only when one is fully freed from material desires can one be purified, and only in that purified state can one serve the Lord.</p>

<p>This is the pure devotional platform.</p>

<p>asasanah—a person who desires (in exchange for service); na—not; vai—indeed; bhrtyah—a qualified servant or pure devotee of the Lord; svamini—from the master; asisah—material benefit; atmanah—for personal sense gratification; na—nor; svami—the master; bhrtyatah—from the servant; svamyam—the prestigious position of being the master; icchan—desiring; yah—any such master who; rati—bestows; ca—also; asisah—material profit.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A servant who desires material profits from his master is certainly not a qualified servant or pure devotee.</p>
<p>Similarly, a master who bestows benedictions upon his servant because of a desire to maintain a prestigious position as master is also not a pure master.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods A demigod cannot become master, for the real master is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The demigods, to keep their prestigious positions, bestow upon their worshipers whatever benedictions the worshipers want.</p>
<p>For example, once it was found that an asura took a benediction from Lord Siva by which the asura would be able to kill someone simply by placing his hands on that person’s head.</p>
<p>Such benedictions are possible to receive from the demigods.</p>
<p>If one worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the Lord will never offer him such condemned benedictions.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.88.8), yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih.</p>
<p>If one is too materialistic but at the same time wants to be a servant of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, because of His supreme compassion for the devotee, takes away all his material opulences and obliges him to be a pure devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja distinguishes between the pure devotee and the pure master.</p>
<p>The Lord is the pure master, the supreme master, whereas an unalloyed devotee with no material motives is the pure servant.</p>
<p>One who has materialistic motivations cannot become a servant, and one who unnecessarily bestows benedictions upon his servant to keep his own prestigious position is not a real master.</p>

<p>We have no other relationship.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, jivera ‘svarupa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’: (Cc.Madhya 20.108) every living being is eternally a servant of the Supreme Lord, Krsna.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: I am the proprietor of all planets, and I am the supreme enjoyer This is the natural position of the Lord, and the natural position of the living being is to surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66)).</p>
<p>If this relationship continues, then real happiness exists eternally between the master and servant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when this eternal relationship is disturbed, the living entity wants to become separately happy and thinks that the master is his order supplier.</p>
<p>In this way there cannot be happiness.</p>
<p>Nor should the master cater to the desires of the servant.</p>
<p>If he does, he is not the real master.</p>
<p>The real master commands, You must do this and the real servant immediately obeys the order.</p>
<p>Unless this relationship between the Supreme Lord and the subordinate living entity is established, there can be no real happiness.</p>
<p>The living entity is asraya, always subordinate, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is visaya, the supreme objective, the goal of life.</p>
<p>Unfortunate persons trapped in this material world do not know this.</p>
<p>Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: (SB 7.5.31) illusioned by the material energy, everyone in this material world is unaware that the only aim of life is to approach Lord Visnu aradhananam sarvesam</p>
<p>visnor aradhanam param</p>
<p>tasmat parataram devi</p>
<p>tadiyanam samarcanam</p>
<p>In the Padma Purana Lord Siva explains to his wife, Parvati, the goddess Durga, that the highest goal of life is to satisfy Lord Visnu, who can be satisfied only when His servant is satisfied.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore teaches, gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah.</p>
<p>One must become a servant of the servant.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja also prayed to Lord Nrsimhadeva that he might be engaged as the servant of the Lord’s servant.</p>
<p>This is the prescribed method of devotional service.</p>
<p>As soon as a devotee wants the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be his order supplier, the Lord immediately refuses to become the master of such a motivated devotee.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham As one surrenders unto Me, I reward him accordingly Materialistic persons are generally inclined to material profits.</p>
<p>As long as one continues in such an adulterated position, he does not receive the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught us how to pray for benedictions from the Lord.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>na dhanam na janam na sundarim</p>
<p>kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye</p>
<p>mama janmani janmanisvare</p>
<p>bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi</p>
<p>O my Lord, I do not want from You any amount of wealth, nor many followers, nor a beautiful wife, for these are all materialistic desires.</p>
<p>But if I have to ask You for any benediction, I pray that in whatever forms of life I may take my birth, under any circumstances, I will not be bereft of Your transcendental devotional service Devotees are always on the positive platform, in contrast to the Mayavadis, who want to make everything impersonal or void.</p>
<p>One cannot remain void (sunyavadi); rather, one must possess something.</p>
<p>Therefore, the devotee, on the positive side, wants to possess something, and this possession is very nicely described by Prahlada Maharaja, who says, If I must take some benediction from You, I pray that within the core of my heart there may be no material desires The desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not at all material.</p>

<p>As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, kamam hrd-rogam.</p>
<p>Materialistic life means that one is afflicted by a formidable disease called lusty desire.</p>
<p>Liberation means freedom from lusty desires because it is only due to such desires that one must accept repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>As long as one’s lusty desires are unfulfilled, one must take birth after birth to fulfill them.</p>
<p>Because of material desires, therefore, one performs various types of activities and receives various types of bodies with which to try to fulfill desires that are never satisfied.</p>
<p>The only remedy is to take to devotional service, which begins when one is free from all material desires.</p>
<p>Anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).</p>
<p>Anya-abhilasita means material desire and sunyam means free from The spiritual soul has spiritual activities and spiritual desires, as described by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi.</p>
<p>Unalloyed devotion to the service of the Lord is the only spiritual desire.</p>
<p>To fulfill this spiritual desire, however, one must be free from all material desires.</p>
<p>Desirelessness means freedom from material desires.</p>
<p>This is described by Srila Rupa Gosvami as Anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).</p>
<p>As soon as one has material desires, one loses his spiritual identity.</p>
<p>Then all the paraphernalia of one’s life, including one’s senses, body, religion, patience and intelligence, are deviated from one’s original Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As soon as one has material desires, one cannot properly use his senses, intelligence, mind and so on for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Mayavadi philosophers want to become impersonal, senseless and mindless, but that is not possible.</p>
<p>The living entity must be living, always existing with desires, ambitions and so on.</p>
<p>These should be purified, however, so that one can desire spiritually and be spiritually ambitious, without material contamination.</p>
<p>In every living entity these propensities exist because he is a living entity.</p>
<p>When materially contaminated, however, one is put into the hands of material misery (janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi).</p>
<p>If one wants to stop repeated birth and death, one must take to the devotional service of the Lord sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam</p>

<p>One is freed from all material designations, and, simply by being employed in the service of the Lord, one’s senses are purified</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Prahlada, a devotee like you never desires any kind of material opulences, either in this life or in the next.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I order you to enjoy the opulences of the demons in this material world, acting as their king until the end of the duration of time occupied by Manu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One Manu lives for a duration of time calculated to be an aggregate of seventy-one yuga cycles, each of which equals 4,300,000 years.</p>
<p>Although atheistic men like to enjoy material opulences and they endeavor with great energy to build big residences, roads, cities and factories, unfortunately they cannot live more than eighty, ninety or at the utmost one hundred years.</p>
<p>Although the materialist exerts so much energy to create a kingdom of hallucinations, he is unable to enjoy it for more than a few years.</p>
<p>However, because Prahlada Maharaja was a devotee, the Lord allowed him to enjoy material opulence as the king of the materialists.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja had taken birth in the family of Hiranyakasipu, who was the topmost materialist, and since Prahlada was the bona fide heir of his father, the Supreme Lord allowed him to enjoy the kingdom created by his father for so many years that no materialist could calculate them.</p>
<p>A devotee does not have to desire material opulence, but if he is a pure devotee, there is ample opportunity for him to enjoy material happiness also, without personal endeavor.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone is advised to take to devotional service under all circumstances.</p>
<p>If one desires material opulence, he can also become a pure devotee, and his desires will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Therefore, give up fruitive activities and worship Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When a devotee becomes materially very opulent, one should not think that he is enjoying the results of his fruitive activities.</p>
<p>A devotee in this material world uses all material opulences for the service of the Lord because he is planning how to serve the Lord with these opulences, as advised by the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Whatever material opulence is within his possession he engages to expand the glories and service of the Lord.</p>
<p>A devotee never performs any fruitive or ritualistic ceremony to enjoy the results of such karma.</p>
<p>Rather, a devotee knows that karma-kanda is meant for the less intelligent man.</p>
<p>Narottama dasa Thakura says in his prema-bhakti-candrika, karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda: both karma-kanda and jnana-kanda—fruitive activities and speculation about the Supreme Lord—are like pots of poison.</p>
<p>One who is attracted to karma-kanda and jnana-kanda spoils his existence as a human being.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says: evam prahladasyamsena sadhana-siddhatvam nitya-siddhatvam ca naradadivaj jneyam.</p>
<p>There are two classes of devotees—the sadhana-siddha and the nitya-siddha.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja is a mixed siddha; that is, he is perfect partly because of executing devotional service and partly because of eternal perfection.</p>
<p>Thus he is compared to such devotees as Narada.</p>
<p>Formerly, Narada Muni was the son of a maidservant, and therefore in his next birth he attained perfection (sadhana-siddhi) because of having executed devotional service.</p>
<p>Yet he is also a nitya-siddha because he never forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The word kusalena is very important.</p>
<p>One should live in the material world very expertly.</p>
<p>The material world is known as the world of duality because one sometimes has to act impiously and sometimes has to act piously.</p>
<p>Although one does not want to act impiously, the world is so fashioned that there is always danger (padam padam yad vipadam).</p>
<p>Thus even when performing devotional service a devotee has to create many enemies.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja himself had experience of this, for even his father became his enemy.</p>
<p>A devotee should expertly manage to think always of the Supreme Lord so that the reactions of suffering cannot touch him.</p>
<p>This is the expert management of papa-punya—pious and impious activities.</p>
<p>An exalted devotee like Prahlada Maharaja is jivan-mukta; he is liberated even in this very life in the material body.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who always remembers your activities and My activities also, and who chants the prayers you have offered, becomes free, in due course of time, from the reactions of material activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here it is stated that anyone who chants and hears about the activities of Prahlada Maharaja and, in relationship with Prahlada’s activities, the activities of Nrsimhadeva, gradually becomes free from all the bondage of fruitive activities.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.15, 2.56):</p>
<p>yam hi na vyathayanty ete</p>
<p>purusam purusarsabha</p>
<p>sama-duhkha-sukham dhiram</p>
<p>so ’mrtatvaya kalpate</p>
<p>O best among men (Arjuna), the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation</p>
<p>duhkhesv anudvigna-manah</p>
<p>sukhesu vigata-sprhah</p>
<p>vita-raga-bhaya-krodhah</p>
<p>sthita-dhir munir ucyate</p>
<p>(Bg.2.56)</p>
<p>One who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries, who is not elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind A devotee should not be aggrieved in an awkward position, nor should he feel extraordinarily happy in material opulence.</p>
<p>This is the way of expert management of material life.</p>
<p>Because a devotee knows how to manage expertly, he is called jivan-mukta.</p>
<p>As Rupa Gosvami explains in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:</p>
<p>iha yasya harer dasye</p>
<p>karmana manasa gira</p>
<p>nikhilasv apy avasthasu</p>
<p>jivan-muktah sa ucyate</p>
<p>A person acting in Krsna consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Krsna) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within this material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities Because of constantly engaging in devotional service, in any condition of life, a devotee is free from all material bondage bhaktih punati man-nistha</p>
<p>sva-pakan api sambhavat</p>
<p>Even one born in a family of meat-eaters is purified if he engages in devotional service (Bhag.11.14.21) Srila Jiva Gosvami cites this verse in logically supporting that anyone who chants about the pure life and activities of Prahlada Maharaja is freed from the reactions of material activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja said: O Supreme Lord, because You are so merciful to the fallen souls, I ask You for only one benediction.</p>
<p>I know that my father, at the time of his death, had already been purified by Your glance upon him, but because of his ignorance of Your beautiful power and supremacy, he was unnecessarily angry at You, falsely thinking that You were the killer of his brother.</p>
<p>Thus he directly blasphemed Your Lordship, the spiritual master of all living beings, and committed heavily sinful activities directed against me, Your devotee.</p>
<p>I wish that he be excused for these sinful activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Hiranyakasipu was purified as soon as he came in contact with the Lord’s lap and the Lord saw him, Prahlada Maharaja still wanted to hear from the Lord’s own mouth that his father had been purified by the Lord’s causeless mercy.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja offered this prayer to the Lord for the sake of his father.</p>
<p>As a Vaisnava son, despite all the inconveniences imposed upon him by his father, he could not forget his father’s affection.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Prahlada, O most pure, O great saintly person, your father has been purified, along with twenty-one forefathers in your family.</p>
<p>Because you were born in this family, the entire dynasty has been purified.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word trih-saptabhih means seven multiplied by three.</p>
<p>In one’s family one can count back four or five generations—to one’s great-grandfather or even one’s great-grandfather’s father—but since the Lord mentions twenty-one forefathers, this indicates that the benediction expands to other families also.</p>
<p>Before the present family in which one has taken birth, one must have been born in other families.</p>
<p>Thus when a Vaisnava takes birth in a family, by the grace of the Lord he purifies not only that family but also the families of his previous births.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear child, your father has already been purified just by the touch of My body at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the duty of a son is to perform the sraddha ritualistic ceremony after his father’s death so that his father may be promoted to a planetary system where he may become a good citizen and devotee.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that although Hiranyakasipu was already purified, he had to take birth on a higher planetary system to become a devotee again.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja was advised to perform the ritualistic ceremony as a matter of etiquette, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead under no circumstances wants to stop the regulative principles.</p>
<p>Madhva Muni also instructs:</p>
<p>madhu-kaitabhau bhakty-abhava</p>
<p>durau bhagavato mrtau</p>
<p>tama eva kramad aptau</p>
<p>bhaktya ced yo harim yayau</p>

<p>When one becomes a devotee, he no longer has any duty to the Vedic regulative principles.</p>
<p>One has many duties to perform, but if one becomes fully devoted to the Lord, he no longer has any such obligations.</p>

<p>One who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord is no longer a debtor to his forefathers, the great sages, human society, the common man or any living entity.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead nonetheless advised Prahlada Maharaja to follow the regulative principles, for since he was going to be the king, others would follow his example.</p>

<p>It is essential that society be divided into four groups of men—brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras.</p>
<p>Here we see that although Prahlada was perfect in every respect, he nonetheless followed the instructions of the brahmanas who performed the Vedic rituals.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Not only Sisupala and Dantavakra but also many, many other kings who acted as enemies of Krsna attained salvation at the time of death.</p>
<p>Because they thought of the Lord, they received spiritual bodies and forms the same as His, just as worms captured by a black drone obtain the same type of body as the drone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mystery of yogic meditation is explained here.</p>
<p>Real yogis always meditate on the form of Visnu within their hearts.</p>
<p>Consequently, at the time of death they give up their bodies while thinking of the form of Visnu and thus attain Visnuloka, Vaikunthaloka, where they receive bodily features the same as those of the Lord.</p>
<p>From the Sixth Canto we have already learned that when the Visnudutas came from Vaikuntha to deliver Ajamila, they looked exactly like Visnu, with four hands and the same features as Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore, we may conclude that if one practices thinking of Visnu and is fully absorbed in thinking of Him at the time of death, one returns home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Even enemies of Krsna who thought of Krsna in fear (bhaya), such as King Kamsa, received bodies in a spiritual identity similar to that of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By devotional service, pure devotees who incessantly think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead receive bodies similar to His.</p>
<p>This is known as sarupya-mukti.</p>
<p>Although Sisupala, Dantavakra and other kings thought of Krsna as an enemy, they also achieved the same result.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Caitanya-caritamrta, in connection with Lord Caitanya’s instructions to Sanatana Gosvami, it is explained that a devotee should externally execute his routine devotional service in a regular way but should always inwardly think of the particular mellow in which he is attracted to the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This constant thought of the Lord makes the devotee eligible to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: after giving up his body, a devotee does not again receive a material body, but goes back to Godhead and receives a spiritual body resembling those of the Lord’s eternal associates whose activities he followed.</p>
<p>However the devotee likes to serve the Lord, he may constantly think of the Lord’s associates—the cowherd boys, the gopis, the Lord’s father and mother, His servants and the trees, land, animals, plants and water in the Lord’s abode.</p>
<p>Because of constantly thinking of these features, one acquires a transcendental position.</p>
<p>Kings like Sisupala, Dantavakra, Kamsa, Paundraka, Narakasura and Salva were all similarly delivered.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Madhvacarya:</p>
<p>paundrake narake caiva</p>
<p>salve kamse ca rukmini</p>
<p>avistas tu harer bhaktas</p>
<p>tad-bhaktya harim apire</p>
<p>Paundraka, Narakasura, Salva and Kamsa were all inimical toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because all these kings constantly thought of Him, they achieved the same liberation—sarupya-mukti.</p>
<p>The jnana-bhakta, the devotee who follows the path of jnana, also attains the same destination.</p>
<p>If even the enemies of the Lord achieve salvation by constantly thinking about the Lord, what is to be said of pure devotees who always engage in the Lord’s service and who think of nothing but the Lord in every activity?</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this narration about Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, various expansions or incarnations of the Lord have been described, and the killing of the two demons Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu has also been described.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Avataras, or incarnations, are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—Krsna, Govinda advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam</p>
<p>adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca</p>
<p>vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person—nondual, infallible, and without beginning.</p>
<p>Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth.</p>
<p>Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees (Brahma-samhita5.33) The Brahma-samhita describes the avataras.</p>
<p>Indeed, all the avataras are described in the authentic scriptures.</p>
<p>No one can become an avatara, or incarnation, although this has become fashionable in the age of Kali.</p>
<p>The avataras are described in the authentic scriptures (sastras), and therefore before one risks accepting a pretender as an avatara, one should refer to the sastras.</p>
<p>The sastras say everywhere that Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead and that He has innumerable avataras, or incarnations.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Brahma-samhita it is said, ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan: (Bs.5.39) Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha and many others are consecutive expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>After Krsna comes Balarama, after Balarama is Sankarsana, then Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Narayana and then the purusa-avataras—Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>All of them are avataras.</p>
<p>One must hear about the avataras.</p>
<p>Narrations about such avataras are called avatara-katha, the narrations of Krsna’s expansions.</p>
<p>Hearing and chanting these narrations is completely pious.</p>
<p>Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah (Bhag.1.2.17).</p>
<p>One who hears and chants can become punya, purified of material contamination.</p>
<p>Whenever there are references to the avataras, religious principles are established, and demons who are against Krsna are killed.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is spreading all over the world with two aims—to establish Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to kill all the pretenders who falsely present themselves as avataras.</p>
<p>The preachers of the Krsna consciousness movement must carry this conviction very carefully within their hearts and kill the demons who in many tactful ways vilify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>If we take shelter of Nrsimhadeva and Prahlada Maharaja, it will be easier to kill the demons who are against Krsna and to thus reestablish Krsna’s supremacy.</p>
<p>Krsnas tu bhagavan svayam: Krsna is the Supreme Lord, the original Lord.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja is our guru, and Krsna is our worshipable God.</p>
<p>As advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija.</p>
<p>If we can be successful in getting the mercy of Prahlada Maharaja and also that of Nrsimhadeva, then our Krsna consciousness movement will be extremely successful.</p>
<p>The demon Hiranyakasipu had so many ways to try to become God himself, but although Prahlada Maharaja was chastised and threatened in many ways, he rigidly refused to accept his powerful demoniac father as God.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, we should reject all the rascals who pretend to be God.</p>
<p>We must accept Krsna and His incarnations, and no one else.</p>

<p>When one is well conversant with all these principles, he becomes a devotee and performs bhagavata-dharma.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja, the spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession, advised that this bhagavata-dharma be instructed to students from the very beginning of their education (kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan iha (SB 7.6.1)).</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After hearing about the activities of Prahlada Maharaja, a pure devotee should be very anxious to follow in his footsteps, but such a devotee might be disappointed, thinking that not every devotee can come to the standard of Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>This is the nature of a pure devotee; he always thinks himself to be the lowest, to be incompetent and unqualified.</p>
<p>Thus after hearing the narration of Prahlada Maharaja’s activities, Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was on the same standard of devotional service as Prahlada, might have been thinking of his own humble position.</p>
<p>Narada Muni, however, could understand Maharaja Yudhisthira’s mind, and therefore he immediately encouraged him by saying that the Pandavas were not less fortunate; they were as good as Prahlada Maharaja because although Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared for Prahlada, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as Krsna was always living with the Pandavas.</p>
<p>Although the Pandavas, because of the influence of Krsna’s yogamaya, could not think of their fortunate position, every saintly person, including the great sage Narada, could understand it, and therefore they constantly visited Maharaja Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>Any pure devotee who is constantly conscious of Krsna is naturally very fortunate.</p>
<p>The word nr-loke, meaning within the material world indicates that before the Pandavas there had been many, many devotees, such as the descendants of the Yadu dynasty and Vasistha, Marici, Kasyapa, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, who were all extremely fortunate.</p>
<p>The Pandavas, however, were better than all of them because Krsna Himself lived with them constantly.</p>
<p>Narada Muni therefore specifically mentioned that within this material world (nr-loke) the Pandavas were the most fortunate.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—that (Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna); va—also; ayam—this; brahma—the impersonal Brahman (which is an emanation from Krsna); mahat—by great personalities; vimrgya—searched for; kaivalya—oneness; nirvana-sukha—of transcendental happiness; anubhutih—the source of practical experience; priyah—very, very dear; suhrt—well-wisher; vah—of you; khalu—indeed; matuleyah—the son of a maternal uncle; atma—exactly like body and soul together; arhaniyah—worshipable (because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead); vidhi-krt—(yet He serves you as) an order carrier; guruh—your supreme advisor; ca—as well.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The impersonal Brahman is Krsna Himself because Krsna is the source of the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>He is the origin of the transcendental bliss sought by great saintly persons, yet He, the Supreme Person, is your most dear friend and constant well-wisher and is intimately related to you as the son of your maternal uncle.</p>
<p>Indeed, He is always like your body and soul.</p>
<p>He is worshipable, yet He acts as your servant and sometimes as your spiritual master.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is always a difference of opinion about the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>One class of transcendentalists concludes that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and another class concludes that the Absolute Truth is a person.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, the Absolute Truth is accepted as the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Indeed, that Supreme Person Himself, Lord Krsna, instructs in Bhagavad-gita, brahmano hi pratisthaham (Bg.14.27), mattah parataram nanyat (Bg.7.7) The impersonal Brahman is My partial manifestation, and there is no truth superior to Me That same Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, acted as the supreme friend and relative of the Pandavas, and sometimes He even acted as their servant by carrying a letter from the Pandavas to Dhrtarastra and Duryodhana.</p>
<p>Because Krsna was the well-wisher of the Pandavas, He also acted as guru by becoming the spiritual master of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna accepted Krsna as his spiritual master (sisyas te ’ham sadhi mam tvam prapannam), and Krsna sometimes chastised him.</p>
<p>For example, the Lord said, asocyan anvasocas tvam prajna-vadams ca bhasase: (Bg.2.11) while speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief The Lord also said, kutas tva kasmalam idam visame samupasthitam: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you Such was the intimate relationship between the Pandavas and Krsna.</p>
<p>In the same way, a pure devotee of the Lord is always with Krsna through thick and thin; his way of life is Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the statement of the authority Sri Narada Muni.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Exalted persons like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma could not properly describe the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>May the Lord, who is always worshiped as the protector of all devotees by great saints who observe vows of silence, meditation, devotional service and renunciation, be pleased with us.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Absolute Truth is sought by different persons in different ways, yet He remains inconceivable.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, devotees like the Pandavas, the gopis, the cowherd boys, Mother Yasoda, Nanda Maharaja and all the inhabitants of Vrndavana do not need to practice conventional processes of meditation to attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He remains with them through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Therefore a saint like Narada, understanding the difference between transcendentalists and pure devotees, always prays that the Lord will be pleased with him.</p>

<p>Attacked by Lord Siva’s golden arrows, all the demoniac inhabitants of those three dwellings lost their lives and fell down.</p>
<p>Then the great mystic Maya Danava dropped the demons into a nectarean well that he had created.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The asuras are generally extremely powerful because of their mystic yogic power.</p>
<p>However, as Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):</p>
<p>yoginam api sarvesam</p>
<p>mad-gatenantaratmana</p>
<p>sraddhavan bhajate yo mam</p>
<p>sa me yuktatamo matah</p>
<p>Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all The actual purpose of mystic yoga is to concentrate one’s attention fully on the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and always think of Him (mad-gatenantaratmana).</p>
<p>To attain such perfection, one must undergo a certain process—hatha-yoga—and through this yoga system the practitioner achieves some uncommon mystic power.</p>
<p>The asuras, however, instead of becoming devotees of Krsna, utilize this mystic power for their personal sense gratification.</p>
<p>Maya Danava, for example, is mentioned here as maha-yogi, a great mystic, but his business was to help the asuras.</p>
<p>Nowadays we are actually seeing that there are some yogis who cater to the senses of materialists, and there are imposters who advertise themselves as God.</p>
<p>Maya Danava was such a person, a god among the demons, and he could perform some wonderful feats, one of which is described here: he made a well filled with nectar and dipped the asuras into that nectarean well.</p>
<p>This nectar was known as mrta-sanjivayitari, for it could bring a dead body to life.</p>
<p>Mrta-sanjivayitari is also an Ayur-vedic preparation.</p>
<p>It is a kind of liquor that invigorates even a person on the verge of death.</p>

<p>When Lord Siva was fully equipped in this way, he sat down on the chariot with his arrows and bow to fight with the demons.</p>

<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.13.16): vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh: Lord Siva is the best of the Vaisnavas, the devotees of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is one of the mahajanas, the twelve authorities on Vaisnava philosophy (svayambhur naradah sambhuh kumarah kapilo manuh, etc (SB 6.3.20)).</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is always prepared to help all the mahajanas and devotees in every respect (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati).</p>
<p>Although Lord Siva is very powerful, he lost a battle to the asuras, and therefore he was morose and disappointed.</p>
<p>However, because he is one of the chief devotees of the Lord, the Lord personally equipped him with all the paraphernalia for war.</p>
<p>The devotee, therefore, must serve the Lord sincerely, and Krsna is always in the background to protect him and, if need be, to equip him fully to fight with his enemy.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord, Sri Krsna, appeared as a human being, yet He performed many uncommon and wonderful pastimes by His own potency.</p>
<p>How can I say more about His activities than what has already been said by great saintly persons? Everyone can be purified by His activities, simply by hearing about them from the right source.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita and all the Vedic literatures fully explain that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appears in human society as an ordinary human being but acts very uncommonly for the well-being of the entire world.</p>
<p>One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and think Lord Krsna to be an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>Those who really seek the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that Krsna is everything (vasudevah samam iti).</p>
<p>Such great souls are very rare.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if one studies the entire Bhagavad-gita as it is, Krsna is very easy to understand.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is just trying to make Krsna known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam).</p>
<p>If people take this movement seriously, their lives as human beings will be successful.</p>
