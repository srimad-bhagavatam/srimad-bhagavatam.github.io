<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-naradah uvaca—Narada Muni said; bhakti-yogasya—of the principles of devotional service; tat—those (blessings or benedictions offered by Lord Nrsimhadeva); sarvam—each and every one of them; antarayataya—because of being impediments (on the path of bhakti-yoga); arbhakah—Prahlada Maharaja, although only a boy; manyamanah—considering; hrsikesam—unto Lord Nrsimhadeva; smayamanah—smiling; uvaca—said; ha—in the past.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The saint Narada Muni continued: Although Prahlada Maharaja was only a boy, when he heard the benedictions offered by Lord Nrsimhadeva he considered them impediments on the path of devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he smiled very mildly and spoke as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material achievements are not the ultimate goal of devotional service.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of devotional service is love of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore although Prahlada Maharaja, Dhruva Maharaja, Ambarisa Maharaja, Yudhisthira Maharaja and many devotee kings were materially very opulent, they accepted their material opulence in the service of the Lord, not for their personal sense gratification.</p>
<p>Of course, possessing material opulence is always fearful because under the influence of material opulence one may be misdirected from devotional service.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a pure devotee (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)) is never misdirected by material opulence.</p>
<p>On the contrary, whatever he possesses he engages one hundred percent in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>When one is allured by material possessions, they are considered to be given by maya, but when one uses material possessions fully for service, they are considered God’s gifts, or facilities offered by Krsna for enhancing one’s devotional service.</p>
