<h1><a class="header" href="#hiranyakasipu-terrorizes-the-universe" id="hiranyakasipu-terrorizes-the-universe">Hiranyakasipu Terrorizes the Universe</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#74" id="74">7.4</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter fully describes how Hiranyakasipu obtained power from Lord Brahma and misused it by harassing all the living entities within this universe.</p>
<p>By severe austerities, Hiranyakasipu satisfied Lord Brahma and obtained the benedictions he desired.</p>
<p>After he received these benedictions, his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived with full beauty and a luster like gold.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Visnu, unable to forget Lord Visnu’s having killed his brother.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and the three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras, under his control.</p>
<p>Becoming the master of all places, including the residence of Indra, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life in great luxury and thus became mad.</p>
<p>All the demigods but Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva came under his control and began serving him, but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he was always puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations.</p>
<p>All the brahmanas were dissatisfied with him, and they cursed him with determination.</p>
<p>Eventually, all the living entities within the universe, represented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief from Hiranyakasipu’s rule.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu informed the demigods that they and the other living entities would be saved from the fearful conditions created by Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Since Hiranyakasipu was the oppressor of all the demigods, the followers of the Vedas, the cows, the brahmanas and the religious, saintly persons, and since he was envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed very soon.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu’s last exploit would be to torment his own son Prahlada, who was a maha-bhagavata, an exalted Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Then his life would end.</p>
<p>When the demigods were thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by Hiranyakasipu would come to an end.</p>
<p>Finally, Narada Muni describes the characteristics of Prahlada Maharaja, the son of Hiranyakasipu, and describes how his father envied his own qualified son.</p>
<p>In this way the chapter ends.</p>
