<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya told Vidura: When the demigods were thus reassured by the Personality of Godhead, they were freed from all fears, and after offering their obeisances, they returned to their heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Then the Lord, who is nondifferent from the Sahasrasirsa incarnation, got on the back of Garuda, who carried Him to the Madhuvana Forest to see His servant Dhruva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word sahasrasirsa refers to the Personality of Godhead known as Garbhodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Although the Lord appeared as Ksirodakasayi Visnu, He has been described here as Sahasrasirsa Visnu because He is nondifferent from Garbhodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>According to Srila Sanatana Gosvami in his Bhagavatamrta, the Sahasrasirsa Personality of Godhead who appeared at that time was the incarnation known as Prsnigarbha.</p>
<p>He created the planet known as Dhruvaloka for the habitation of Dhruva Maharaja.</p>
