<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Suta Gosvami, continuing to speak to all the rsis, headed by Saunaka, said: After hearing Maitreya Rsi describe Dhruva Maharaja’s ascent to Lord Visnu’s abode, Vidura became very much enlightened in devotional emotion, and he inquired from Maitreya as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As evidenced in the topics between Vidura and Maitreya, the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the devotees are so fascinating that neither the devotee who is describing them nor the devotee who is hearing is at all fatigued by the inquiries and answers.</p>
<p>Transcendental subject matter is so nice that no one becomes tired of hearing or speaking.</p>
<p>Others, who are not devotees, may think, How can people devote so much time simply to talks of God But devotees are never satisfied or satiated in hearing and speaking about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about His devotees.</p>
<p>The more they hear and talk, the more they become enthusiastic to hear.</p>
<p>The chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra is simply the repetition of three words, Hare, Krsna and Rama, but still devotees can go on chanting this Hare Krsna mantra twenty-four hours a day without feeling fatigued.</p>
