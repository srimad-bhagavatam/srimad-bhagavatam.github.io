<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—Maitreya said; sada—constantly; vidvisatoh—the tension; evam—in this manner; kalah—time; vai—certainly; dhriyamanayoh—continued to bear; jamatuh—of the son-in-law; svasurasya—of the father-in-law; api—even; su-mahan—a very great; aticakrame—passed.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maitreya continued: In this manner the tension between the father-in-law and son-in-law, Daksa and Lord Siva, continued for a considerably long period.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The previous chapter has already explained that Vidura questioned the sage Maitreya as to the cause of the misunderstanding between Lord Siva and Daksa.</p>
<p>Another question is why the strife between Daksa and his son-in-law caused Sati to destroy her body.</p>
<p>The chief reason for Sati’s giving up her body was that her father, Daksa, began another sacrificial performance, to which Lord Siva was not invited at all.</p>
<p>Generally, when any sacrifice is performed, although each and every sacrifice is intended to pacify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, all the demigods, especially Lord Brahma and Lord Siva and the other principal demigods, such as Indra and Candra, are invited, and they take part.</p>
<p>It is said that unless all the demigods are present, no sacrifice is complete.</p>
<p>But in the tension between the father-in-law and son-in-law, Daksa began another yajna performance, to which Lord Siva was not invited.</p>
<p>Daksa was the chief progenitor employed by Lord Brahma, and he was a son of Brahma, so he had a high position and was also very proud.</p>
