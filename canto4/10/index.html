<h1>Dhruva Maharaja’s Fight With the Yaksas</h1>
<p><strong>4.10.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>prajapater duhitaram</p>
<p>sisumarasya vai dhruvah</p>
<p>upayeme bhramim nama</p>
<p>tat-sutau kalpa-vatsarau</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—the great sage Maitreya continued; prajapateh—of the Prajapati; duhitaram—daughter; sisumarasya—of Sisumara; vai—certainly; dhruvah—Dhruva Maharaja; upayeme—married; bhramim—Bhrami; nama—named; tat-sutau—her sons; kalpa—Kalpa; vatsarau—Vatsara.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, thereafter Dhruva Maharaja married the daughter of Prajapati Sisumara, whose name was Bhrami, and two sons named Kalpa and Vatsara were born of her.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that Dhruva Maharaja married after being installed on the throne of his father and after the departure of his father to the forest for self-realization.</p>
<p>It is very important to note in this connection that since Maharaja Uttanapada was greatly affectionate towards his son, and since it is the duty of a father to get his sons and daughters married as quickly as possible, why did he not get his son married before he left home? The answer is that Maharaja Uttanapada was a rajarsi, saintly king.</p>
<p>Although he was busy in his political affairs and duties of government management, he was very anxious for self-realization.</p>
<p>Therefore as soon as his son Dhruva Maharaja was quite worthy to take charge of the government, he took this opportunity to leave home, just like his son, who, without fear, left home for self-realization, even at the age of five years.</p>
<p>These are rare instances from which we can see that the importance of spiritual realization is above all other important work.</p>
<p>Maharaja Uttanapada knew very well that to get his son Dhruva Maharaja married was not so important that it should take preference to his going away to the forest for self-realization.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The greatly powerful Dhruva Maharaja had another wife, named Ila, who was the daughter of the demigod Vayu.</p>
<p>By her he begot a son named Utkala and a very beautiful daughter.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.3</strong></p>
<p>uttamas tv akrtodvaho</p>
<p>mrgayayam baliyasa</p>
<p>hatah punya-janenadrau</p>
<p>tan-matasya gatim gata</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja’s younger brother Uttama, who was still unmarried, once went on a hunting excursion and was killed by a powerful Yaksa in the Himalaya Mountains.</p>
<p>Along with him, his mother, Suruci, also followed the path of her son (she died).</p>



<p><strong>4.10.4</strong></p>
<p>dhruvo bhratr-vadham srutva</p>
<p>kopamarsa-sucarpitah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Dhruva Maharaja heard of the killing of his brother Uttama by the Yaksas in the Himalaya Mountains, being overwhelmed with lamentation and anger, he got on his chariot and went out for victory over the city of the Yaksas, Alakapuri.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja’s becoming angry, overwhelmed with grief, and envious of the enemies was not incompatible with his position as a great devotee.</p>
<p>It is a misunderstanding that a devotee should not be angry, envious or overwhelmed by lamentation.</p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja was the king, and when his brother was unceremoniously killed, it was his duty to take revenge against the Yaksas from the Himalayas.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.5</strong></p>
<p>gatvodicim disam raja</p>
<p>rudranucara-sevitam</p>
<p>dadarsa himavad-dronyam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja went to the northern direction of the Himalayan range.</p>
<p>In a valley he saw a city full of ghostly persons who were followers of Lord Siva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse it is stated that the Yaksas are more or less devotees of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>By this indication the Yaksas may be taken to be the Himalayan tribes like the Tibetans.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.6</strong></p>
<p>dadhmau sankham brhad-bahuh</p>
<p>kham disas canunadayan</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, as soon as Dhruva Maharaja reached Alakapuri, he immediately blew his conchshell, and the sound reverberated throughout the entire sky and in every direction.</p>
<p>The wives of the Yaksas became very much frightened.</p>
<p>From their eyes it was apparent that they were full of anxiety.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.7</strong></p>
<p>tato niskramya balina</p>

<p><strong>4.10.8</strong></p>
<p>sa tan apatato vira</p>
<p>ugra-dhanva maha-rathah</p>
<p>ekaikam yugapat sarvan</p>
<p>ahan banais tribhis tribhih</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja, who was a great charioteer and certainly a great bowman also, immediately began to kill them by simultaneously discharging arrows three at a time.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.9</strong></p>
<p>te vai lalata-lagnais tair</p>
<p>isubhih sarva eva hi</p>
<p>matva nirastam atmanam</p>
<p>asamsan karma tasya tat</p>

<p>te—they; vai—certainly; lalata-lagnaih—intent upon their heads; taih—by those; isubhih—arrows; sarve—all of them; eva—certainly; hi—without fail; matva—thinking; nirastam—defeated; atmanam—themselves; asamsan—praised; karma—action; tasya—of him; tat—that.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the heroes of the Yaksas saw that all their heads were being thus threatened by Dhruva Maharaja, they could very easily understand their awkward position, and they concluded that they would certainly be defeated.</p>
<p>But, as heroes, they lauded the action of Dhruva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This spirit of fighting in a sporting attitude is very significant in this verse.</p>
<p>The Yaksas were severely attacked.</p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja was their enemy, but still, upon witnessing the wonderful, heroic acts of Maharaja Dhruva, they were very pleased with him.</p>
<p>This straightforward appreciation of an enemy’s prowess is a characteristic of real ksatriya spirit.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.10</strong></p>
<p>te ’pi camum amrsyantah</p>
<p>pada-sparsam ivoragah</p>
<p>sarair avidhyan yugapad</p>
<p>dvi-gunam pracikirsavah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>te—the Yaksas; api—also; ca—and; amum—at Dhruva; amrsyantah—being intolerant of; pada-sparsam—being touched by the feet; iva—like; uragah—serpents; saraih—with arrows; avidhyan—struck; yugapat—simultaneously; dvi-gunam—twice as much; pracikirsavah—trying to retaliate.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just like serpents, who cannot tolerate being trampled upon by anyone’s feet, the Yaksas, being intolerant of the wonderful prowess of Dhruva Maharaja, threw twice as many arrows—six from each of their soldiers—and thus they very valiantly exhibited their prowess.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.11-12</strong></p>
<p>tatah parigha-nistrimsaih</p>
<p>prasasula-parasvadhaih</p>

<p><strong>4.10.13</strong></p>
<p>auttanapadih sa tada</p>
<p>sastra-varsena bhurina</p>
<p>na evadrsyatacchanna</p>
<p>asarena yatha girih</p>

<p>auttanapadih—Dhruva Maharaja; sah—he; tada—at that time; sastra-varsena—by a shower of weapons; bhurina—incessant; na—not; eva—certainly; adrsyata—was visible; acchannah—being covered; asarena—by constant rainfall; yatha—as; girih—a mountain.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja was completely covered by an incessant shower of weapons, just as a mountain is covered by incessant rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura points out in this connection that although Dhruva Maharaja was covered by the incessant arrows of the enemy, this does not mean that he succumbed in the battle.</p>
<p>The example of a mountain peak’s being covered by incessant rain is just suitable, for when a mountain is covered by incessant rain, all dirty things are washed from the body of the mountain.</p>
<p>Similarly, the incessant shower of arrows from the enemy gave Dhruva Maharaja new vigor to defeat them.</p>
<p>In other words, whatever incompetency he might have had was washed away.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.14</strong></p>
<p>haha-karas tadaivasit</p>
<p>siddhanam divi pasyatam</p>
<p>hato ’yam manavah suryo</p>
<p>magnah punya-janarnave</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>haha-karah—tumult of disappointment; tada—at that time; eva—certainly; asit—became manifest; siddhanam—of all the residents of Siddhaloka; divi—in the sky; pasyatam—who were observing the fight; hatah—killed; ayam—this; manavah—grandson of Manu; suryah—sun; magnah—set; punya-jana—of the Yaksas; arnave—in the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All the Siddhas from the higher planetary systems were observing the fight from the sky, and when they saw that Dhruva Maharaja had been covered by the incessant arrows of the enemy, they roared tumultuously, The grandson of Manu, Dhruva, is now lost They cried that Dhruva Maharaja was just like the sun and that now he had set within the ocean of the Yaksas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the word manava is very significant.</p>
<p>Generally this word is used to mean human being Dhruva Maharaja is also described here as manava.</p>
<p>Not only is Dhruva Maharaja a descendant of Manu, but all human society descends from Manu.</p>
<p>According to Vedic civilization, Manu is the lawgiver.</p>
<p>Even today Hindus in India follow the laws given by Manu.</p>
<p>Everyone, therefore, in human society is a manava, or descendant from Manu, but Dhruva Maharaja is a distinguished manava because he is a great devotee.</p>
<p>The denizens of the planet Siddhaloka, where the residents can fly in the sky without airplanes, were anxious over Dhruva Maharaja’s welfare in the battlefield.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami says, therefore, that not only is a devotee well protected by the Supreme Lord, but all the demigods, and even ordinary men, are anxious for his security and safety.</p>
<p>The comparison given here that Dhruva Maharaja appeared to merge in the ocean of the Yaksas is also significant.</p>
<p>When the sun sets on the horizon, it appears that the sun drowns in the ocean, but factually the sun has no difficulty.</p>
<p>Similarly, although Dhruva appeared to drown in the ocean of the Yaksas, he had no difficulty.</p>
<p>As the sun rises again in due course at the end of night, so Dhruva Maharaja, although he might have been in difficulty (because, after all, it was a fight, and in any fighting activities there are reverses), that did not mean that he was defeated.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.15</strong></p>
<p>nadatsu yatudhanesu</p>
<p>jaya-kasisv atho mrdhe</p>
<p>udatisthad rathas tasya</p>
<p>niharad iva bhaskarah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nadatsu—while exclaiming; yatudhanesu—the ghostly Yaksas; jaya-kasisu—proclaiming victory; atho—then; mrdhe—in the fighting; udatisthat—appeared; rathah—the chariot; tasya—of Dhruva Maharaja; niharat—from the mist; iva—like; bhaskarah—the sun.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Yaksas, being temporarily victorious, exclaimed that they had conquered Dhruva Maharaja.</p>
<p>But in the meantime Dhruva’s chariot suddenly appeared, just as the sun suddenly appears from within foggy mist.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here Dhruva Maharaja is compared to the sun and the great assembly of the Yaksas to foggy mist.</p>
<p>Fog is insignificant in comparison with the sun.</p>
<p>Although the sun is sometimes seen to be covered by fog, in fact the sun cannot be covered by anything.</p>
<p>Our eyes may be covered by a cloud, but the sun is never covered.</p>
<p>By this comparison to the sun, the greatness of Dhruva Maharaja in all circumstances is affirmed.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.16</strong></p>
<p>dhanur visphurjayan divyam</p>
<p>dvisatam khedam udvahan</p>
<p>astraugham vyadhamad banair</p>

<p>dhanuh—his bow; visphurjayan—twanging; divyam—wonderful; dvisatam—of the enemies; khedam—lamentation; udvahan—creating; astra-ogham—different types of weapons; vyadhamat—he scattered; banaih—with his arrows; ghana—of clouds; anikam—an army; iva—like; anilah—the wind.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja’s bow and arrows twanged and hissed, causing lamentation in the hearts of his enemies.</p>
<p>He began to shoot incessant arrows, shattering all their different weapons, just as the blasting wind scatters the assembled clouds in the sky.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.17</strong></p>
<p>tasya te capa-nirmukta</p>
<p>bhittva varmani raksasam</p>
<p>kayan avivisus tigma</p>
<p>girin asanayo yatha</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasya—of Dhruva; te—those arrows; capa—from the bow; nirmuktah—released; bhittva—having pierced; varmani—shields; raksasam—of the demons; kayan—bodies; avivisuh—entered; tigmah—sharp; girin—mountains; asanayah—thunderbolts; yatha—just like.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sharp arrows released from the bow of Dhruva Maharaja pierced the shields and bodies of the enemy, like the thunderbolts released by the King of heaven, which dismantle the bodies of the mountains.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.18-19</strong></p>
<p>bhallaih sanchidyamananam</p>
<p>sirobhis caru-kundalaih</p>

<p>dorbhir valaya-valgubhih</p>

<p>usnisais ca maha-dhanaih</p>
<p>astrtas ta rana-bhuvo</p>
<p>rejur vira-mano-harah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>bhallaih—by his arrows; sanchidyamananam—of the Yaksas who were cut to pieces; sirobhih—with heads; caru—beautiful; kundalaih—with earrings; urubhih—with thighs; hema-talabhaih—like golden palm trees; dorbhih—with arms; valaya-valgubhih—with beautiful bracelets; hara—with garlands; keyura—armlets; mukutaih—and helmets; usnisaih—with turbans; ca—also; maha-dhanaih—very valuable; astrtah—covered; tah—those; rana-bhuvah—battlefield; rejuh—began to glimmer; vira—of the heroes; manah-harah—bewildering the minds.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, the heads of those who were cut to pieces by the arrows of Dhruva Maharaja were decorated very beautifully with earrings and turbans.</p>
<p>The legs of their bodies were as beautiful as golden palm trees, their arms were decorated with golden bracelets and armlets, and on their heads there were very valuable helmets bedecked with gold.</p>
<p>All these ornaments lying on that battlefield were very attractive and could bewilder the mind of a hero.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that in those days soldiers used to go to the battlefield highly decorated with golden ornaments and with helmets and turbans, and when they were dead the booty was taken by the enemy party.</p>
<p>Their falling dead in battle with their many golden ornamental dresses was certainly a lucrative opportunity for the heroes on the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The remaining Yaksas who somehow or other were not killed had their limbs cut to pieces by the arrows of the great warrior Dhruva Maharaja.</p>
<p>Thus they began to flee, just as elephants flee when defeated by a lion.</p>



<p><strong>4.10.21</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the meantime, while Dhruva Maharaja, doubtful of his mystic enemies, was talking with his charioteer, they heard a tremendous sound, as if the whole ocean were there, and they found that from the sky a great dust storm was coming over them from all directions.</p>
