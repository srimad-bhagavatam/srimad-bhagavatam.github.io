<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Narada continued: My dear King, after bewildering her husband in different ways and bringing him under her control, the wife of King Puranjana gave him all satisfaction and enjoyed sex life with him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After hunting in the forest, King Puranjana returned home, and after refreshing himself by taking a bath and eating nice food, he searched for his wife.</p>
<p>When he saw her lying down on the ground without a bed, as if neglected, and devoid of any proper dress, he became very much aggrieved.</p>
<p>He then became attracted to her and began to enjoy her company.</p>
<p>A living entity is similarly engaged in the material world in sinful activities.</p>
<p>These sinful activities may be compared to King Puranjana’s hunting in the forest.</p>
<p>A sinful life can be counteracted by various processes of religion such as yajna, vrata and dana—that is, the performance of sacrifices, the taking of a vow for some religious ritual, and the giving of charity.</p>
<p>In this way one may become free from the reactions of sinful life and at the same time awaken his original Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>By coming home, taking his bath, eating nice foodstuffs, getting refreshed and searching out his wife, King Puranjana came to his good consciousness in his family life.</p>
<p>In other words, a systematic family life as enjoined in the Vedas is better than an irresponsible sinful life.</p>
<p>If a husband and wife combine together in Krsna consciousness and live together peacefully, that is very nice.</p>
<p>However, if a husband becomes too much attracted by his wife and forgets his duty in life, the implications of materialistic life will again resume.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami has therefore recommended, anasaktasya visayan (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu1.2.255).</p>
<p>Without being attached by sex, the husband and wife may live together for the advancement of spiritual life.</p>
<p>The husband should engage in devotional service, and the wife should be faithful and religious according to the Vedic injunctions.</p>
<p>Such a combination is very good.</p>
<p>However, if the husband becomes too much attracted to the wife due to sex, the position becomes very dangerous.</p>
<p>Women in general are very much sexually inclined.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is said that a woman’s sex desire is nine times stronger than a man’s.</p>
<p>It is therefore a man’s duty to keep a woman under his control by satisfying her, giving her ornaments, nice food and clothes, and engaging her in religious activities.</p>
<p>Of course, a woman should have a few children and in this way not be disturbing to the man.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the man becomes attracted to the woman simply for sex enjoyment, then family life becomes abominable.</p>
<p>The great politician Canakya Pandita has said: bharya rupavati satruh—a beautiful wife is an enemy.</p>
<p>Of course every woman in the eyes of her husband is very beautiful.</p>
<p>Others may see her as not very beautiful, but the husband, being very much attracted to her, sees her always as very beautiful.</p>
<p>If the husband sees the wife as very beautiful, it is to be assumed that he is too much attracted to her.</p>
<p>This attraction is the attraction of sex.</p>
<p>The whole world is captivated by the two modes of material nature rajo-guna and tamo-guna, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Generally women are very much passionate and are less intelligent; therefore somehow or other a man should not be under the control of their passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>By performing bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, a man can be raised to the platform of goodness.</p>
<p>If a husband situated in the mode of goodness can control his wife, who is in passion and ignorance, the woman is benefited.</p>
<p>Forgetting her natural inclination for passion and ignorance, the woman becomes obedient and faithful to her husband, who is situated in goodness.</p>
<p>Such a life becomes very welcome.</p>
<p>The intelligence of the man and woman may then work very nicely together, and they can make a progressive march toward spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the husband, coming under the control of the wife, sacrifices his quality of goodness and becomes subservient to the qualities of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>In this way the whole situation becomes polluted.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that a household life is better than a sinful life devoid of responsibility, but if in the household life the husband becomes subordinate to the wife, involvement in materialistic life again becomes prominent.</p>
<p>In this way a man’s material bondage becomes enhanced.</p>
<p>Because of this, according to the Vedic system, after a certain age a man is recommended to abandon his family life for the stages of vanaprastha and sannyasa.</p>
