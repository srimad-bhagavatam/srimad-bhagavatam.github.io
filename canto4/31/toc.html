<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great saint Maitreya continued: After that, the Pracetas lived at home for thousands of years and developed perfect knowledge in spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p>At last they remembered the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and left home, putting their wife in charge of a perfect son.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After the Pracetas had finished their penances, they were blessed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord blessed them by telling them that after finishing their family life they would return home, back to Godhead, in due course of time.</p>
<p>After finishing their family life, which lasted thousands of years according to the calculations of the demigods, the Pracetas decided to leave home, putting their wife in the charge of a son named Daksa.</p>
<p>This is the process of Vedic civilization.</p>
<p>In the beginning of life, as a brahmacari, one has to undergo severe penances and austerities in order to be educated in spiritual values.</p>
<p>The brahmacari, or student, is never allowed to mingle with women and learn from the beginning of life about sex enjoyment.</p>
<p>The basic flaw in modern civilization is that boys and girls are given freedom during school and college to enjoy sex life.</p>
<p>Most of the children are varna-sankara, meaning born of undesirable fathers and mothers Consequently, the whole world is in chaos.</p>
<p>Actually, human civilization should be based on the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>This means that in the beginning of life boys and girls should undergo penances and austerities.</p>
<p>When they are grown, they should get married, live for some time at home and beget children.</p>
<p>When the children are grown up, the man should leave home and search for Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In this way one can make one’s life perfect by going home to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Unless one practices penances and austerities in his student life, he cannot understand the existence of God.</p>
<p>Without realizing Krsna, one cannot make his life perfect.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that when the children are grown, the wife should be put in the children’s charge.</p>
<p>The husband may then leave home to develop Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Everything depends on the development of mature knowledge.</p>
<p>King Pracinabarhisat, the father of the Pracetas, left home before the arrival of his sons, who were engaged in austerity within the water.</p>
<p>As soon as the time is ripe, or as soon as one has developed perfect Krsna consciousness, he should leave home, even though all his duties may not be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Pracinabarhisat was waiting for the arrival of his sons, but following the instructions of Narada, as soon as his intelligence was properly developed, he simply left instructions for his ministers to impart to his sons.</p>
<p>Thus without waiting for their arrival, he left home.</p>
<p>Giving up a comfortable home life is absolutely necessary for human beings and is advised by Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>Hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam: to finish the materialistic way of life, one should leave his so-called comfortable home life, which is simply a means for killing the soul (atma-patam).</p>
<p>The home is considered to be a dark well covered by grass, and if one falls within this well, he simply dies without anyone’s caring.</p>
<p>One should therefore not be too much attached to family life, for it will spoil one’s development of Krsna consciousness.</p>
