<h1>King Prthu’s Appearance and Coronation</h1>
<p><strong>4.15.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>atha tasya punar viprair</p>
<p>aputrasya mahipateh</p>
<p>bahubhyam mathyamanabhyam</p>
<p>mithunam samapadyata</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—Maitreya continued to speak; atha—thus; tasya—his; punah—again; vipraih—by the brahmanas; aputrasya—without a son; mahipateh—of the King; bahubhyam—from the arms; mathyamanabhyam—being churned; mithunam—a couple; samapadyata—took birth.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, thus the brahmanas and the great sages again churned the two arms of King Vena’s dead body.</p>
<p>As a result a male and female couple came out of his arms.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.2</strong></p>
<p>tad drstva mithunam jatam</p>
<p>rsayo brahma-vadinah</p>
<p>ucuh parama-santusta</p>
<p>viditva bhagavat-kalam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—that; drstva—seeing; mithunam—couple; jatam—born; rsayah—the great sages; brahma-vadinah—very learned in Vedic knowledge; ucuh—said; parama—very much; santustah—being pleased; viditva—knowing; bhagavat—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kalam—expansion.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sages were highly learned in Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>When they saw the male and female born of the arms of Vena’s body, they were very pleased, for they could understand that the couple was an expansion of a plenary portion of Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The method adopted by the great sages and scholars, who were learned in Vedic knowledge, was perfect.</p>
<p>They removed all the reactions of King Vena’s sinful activities by seeing that King Vena first gave birth to Bahuka, described in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>After King Vena’s body was thus purified, a male and female came out of it, and the great sages could understand that this was an expansion of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>This expansion, of course, was not visnu-tattva but a specifically empowered expansion of Lord Visnu known as avesa.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.3</strong></p>
<p>rsaya ucuh</p>
<p>esa visnor bhagavatah</p>
<p>kala bhuvana-palini</p>
<p>iyam ca laksmyah sambhutih</p>
<p>purusasyanapayini</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>rsayah ucuh—the sages said; esah—this male; visnoh—of Lord Visnu; bhagavatah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kala—expansion; bhuvana-palini—who maintains the world; iyam—this female; ca—also; laksmyah—of the goddess of fortune; sambhutih—expansion; purusasya—of the Lord; anapayini—inseparable.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sages said: The male is a plenary expansion of the power of Lord Visnu, who maintains the entire universe, and the female is a plenary expansion of the goddess of fortune, who is never separated from the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The significance of the goddess of fortune’s never being separated from the Lord is clearly mentioned herein.</p>
<p>People in the material world are very fond of the goddess of fortune, and they want her favor in the form of riches.</p>
<p>They should know, however, that the goddess of fortune is inseparable from Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Materialists should understand that the goddess of fortune should be worshiped along with Lord Visnu and should not be regarded separately.</p>
<p>Materialists seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune must worship Lord Visnu and Laksmi together to maintain material opulence.</p>
<p>If a materialist follows the policy of Ravana, who wanted to separate Sita from Lord Ramacandra, the process of separation will vanquish him.</p>
<p>Those who are very rich and have taken favor of the goddess of fortune in this world must engage their money in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this way they can continue in their opulent position without disturbance.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.4</strong></p>
<p>ayam tu prathamo rajnam</p>
<p>puman prathayita yasah</p>
<p>prthur nama maharajo</p>
<p>bhavisyati prthu-sravah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ayam—this; tu—then; prathamah—the first; rajnam—of kings; puman—the male; prathayita—will expand; yasah—reputation; prthuh—Maharaja Prthu; nama—by name; maha-rajah—the great king; bhavisyati—will become; prthu-sravah—of wide renown.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Of the two, the male will be able to expand his reputation throughout the world.</p>
<p>His name will be Prthu.</p>
<p>Indeed, he will be the first among kings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are different types of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the sastras it is said that Garuda (the carrier of Lord Visnu) and Lord Siva and Ananta are all very powerful incarnations of the Brahman feature of the Lord.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sacipati, or Indra, the King of heaven, is an incarnation of the lusty feature of the Lord.</p>
<p>Aniruddha is an incarnation of the Lord’s mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, King Prthu is an incarnation of the ruling force of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the saintly persons and great sages predicted the future activities of King Prthu, who was already explained as a partial incarnation of a plenary expansion of the Lord.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.5</strong></p>
<p>iyam ca sudati devi</p>
<p>guna-bhusana-bhusana</p>
<p>arcir nama vararoha</p>
<p>prthum evavarundhati</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The female has such beautiful teeth and beautiful qualities that she will actually beautify the ornaments she wears.</p>
<p>Her name will be Arci.</p>
<p>In the future she will accept King Prthu as her husband.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.6</strong></p>
<p>esa saksad dharer amso</p>
<p>jato loka-riraksaya</p>
<p>iyam ca tat-para hi srir</p>
<p>anujajne ’napayini</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>esah—this male; saksat—directly; hareh—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; amsah—partial representative; jatah—born; loka—the entire world; riraksaya—with a desire to protect; iyam—this female; ca—also; tat-para—very much attached to him; hi—certainly; srih—the goddess of fortune; anujajne—took birth; anapayini—inseparable.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the form of King Prthu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared through a part of His potency to protect the people of the world.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune is the constant companion of the Lord, and therefore she has incarnated partially as Arci to become King Prthu’s queen.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that whenever one sees an extraordinary power, he should conclude that a specific partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present.</p>
<p>There are innumerable such personalities, but not all of them are direct visnu-tattva plenary expansions of the Lord.</p>
<p>Many living entities are classified among the sakti-tattvas.</p>
<p>Such incarnations, empowered for specific purposes, are known as saktyavesa-avataras.</p>
<p>King Prthu was such a saktyavesa-avatara of the Lord.</p>
<p>Similarly, Arci, King Prthu’s wife, was a saktyavesa-avatara of the goddess of fortune.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.7</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>prasamsanti sma tam vipra</p>
<p>gandharva-pravara jaguh</p>
<p>mumucuh sumano-dharah</p>
<p>siddha nrtyanti svah-striyah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—the great saint Maitreya said; prasamsanti sma—praised, glorified; tam—him (Prthu); viprah—all the brahmanas; gandharva-pravarah—the best of the Gandharvas; jaguh—chanted; mumucuh—released; sumanah-dharah—showers of flowers; siddhah—the personalities from Siddhaloka; nrtyanti—were dancing; svah—of the heavenly planes; striyah—women (the Apsaras).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Viduraji, at that time all the brahmanas highly praised and glorified King Prthu, and the best singers of Gandharvaloka chanted his glories.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Siddhaloka showered flowers, and the beautiful women in the heavenly planes danced in ecstasy.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.8</strong></p>
<p>sankha-turya-mrdangadya</p>
<p>nedur dundubhayo divi</p>
<p>tatra sarva upajagmur</p>
<p>devarsi-pitrnam ganah</p>

<p>Great sages, forefathers and personalities from the heavenly planes all came to earth from various planeary systems.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.9-10</strong></p>
<p>brahma jagad-gurur devaih</p>
<p>sahasrtya suresvaraih</p>
<p>vainyasya daksine haste</p>
<p>drstva cihnam gadabhrtah</p>
<p>padayor aravindam ca</p>
<p>tam vai mene hareh kalam</p>
<p>yasyapratihatam cakram</p>
<p>amsah sa paramesthinah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>brahma—Lord Brahma; jagat-guruh—the master of the universe; devaih—by the demigods; saha—accompanied; asrtya—arriving; sura-isvaraih—with the chiefs of all the heavenly planes; vainyasya—of Maharaja Prthu, the son of Vena; daksine—right; haste—on the hand; drstva—seeing; cihnam—mark; gada-bhrtah—of Lord Visnu, who carries a club; padayoh—on the two feet; aravindam—lotus flower; ca—also; tam—him; vai—certainly; mene—he understood; hareh—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kalam—part of a plenary expansion; yasya—whose; apratihatam—invincible; cakram—disc; amsah—partial representation; sah—he; paramesthinah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma, the master of the entire universe, arrived there accompanied by all the demigods and their chiefs.</p>
<p>Seeing the lines of Lord Visnu’s palm on King Prthu’s right hand and impressions of lotus flowers on the soles of his feet, Lord Brahma could understand that King Prthu was a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One whose palm bears the sign of a disc, as well as other such lines, should be considered a partial representation or incarnation of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is a system by which one can detect an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Nowadays it has become a cheap fashion to accept any rascal as an incarnation of God, but from this incident we can see that Lord Brahma personally examined the hands and feet of King Prthu for specific signs.</p>
<p>In their prophecies the learned sages and brahmanas accepted Prthu Maharaja as a plenary partial expansion of the Lord.</p>
<p>During the presence of Lord Krsna, however, a king declared himself Vasudeva, and Lord Krsna killed him.</p>
<p>Before accepting someone as an incarnation of God, one should verify his identity according to the symptoms mentioned in the sastras.</p>
<p>Without these symptoms the pretender is subject to be killed by the authorities for pretending to be an incarnation of God.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.11</strong></p>
<p>tasyabhiseka arabdho</p>
<p>brahmanair brahma-vadibhih</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The learned brahmanas, who were very attached to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, then arranged for the King’s coronation.</p>
<p>People from all directions collected all the different paraphernalia for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Thus everything was complete.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.12</strong></p>
<p>sarit-samudra girayo</p>
<p>naga gavah khaga mrgah</p>
<p>dyauh ksitih sarva-bhutani</p>

<p><strong>4.15.14</strong></p>
<p>tasmai jahara dhanado</p>

<p><strong>4.15.16</strong></p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All the demigods presented various gifts to King Prthu.</p>
<p>Hari, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Upendra in the heavenly plane, presented the King with a Sudarsana disc.</p>
<p>It should be understood that this Sudarsana disc is not exactly the same type of Sudarsana disc used by the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Visnu.</p>
<p>Since Maharaja Prthu was a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s power, the Sudarsana disc given to him represented the partial power of the original Sudarsana disc.</p>



<p><strong>4.15.17</strong></p>
<p>dasa-candram asim rudrah</p>
<p>sata-candram tathambika</p>

<p>Thus as soon as the King placed his feet in the slippers they would immediately carry him wherever he desired.</p>
<p>Mystic yogis can transfer themselves from one place to another whenever they desire.</p>
<p>A similar power was invested in the slippers of King Prthu.</p>

<p><strong>4.15.22</strong></p>
<p>prthur uvaca</p>
<p>bhoh suta he magadha saumya vandil</p>
<p>loke ’dhunaspasta-gunasya me syat</p>
<p>kim asrayo me stava esa yojyatam</p>
<p>ma mayy abhuvan vitatha giro vah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prthuh uvaca—King Prthu said; bhoh suta—O suta; he magadha—O magadha; saumya—gentle; vandin—O devotee offering prayers; loke—in this world; adhuna—just now; aspasta—not distinct; gunasya—whose qualities; me—of me; syat—there may be; kim—why; asrayah—shelter; me—of me; stavah—praise; esah—this; yojyatam—may be applied; ma—never; mayi—unto me; abhuvan—were; vitathah—in vain; girah—words; vah—your.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Prthu said: O gentle suta, magadha and other devotee offering prayers, the qualities of which you have spoken are not distinct in me.</p>
<p>Why then should you praise me for all these qualities when I do not shelter these features? I do not wish for these words meant for me to go in vain, but it is better that they be offered to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The prayers and praises by the suta, magadha and vandi all explained the godly qualities of Maharaja Prthu, for he was a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because the qualities were not yet manifest, however, King Prthu very humbly asked why the devotees should praise him with such exalted words.</p>
<p>He did not want anyone to offer him prayers or glorify him unless he possessed the real qualities of which they spoke.</p>
<p>The offering of prayers was certainly appropriate, for he was an incarnation of Godhead, but he warned that one should not be accepted as an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead without having the godly qualities.</p>
<p>At the present moment there are many so-called incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, but these are merely fools and rascals whom people accept as incarnations of God although they have no godly qualities.</p>
<p>King Prthu desired that his real characteristics in the future might justify such words of praise.</p>
<p>Although there was no fault in the prayers offered, Prthu Maharaja indicated that such prayers should not be offered to an unfit person who pretends to be an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>tasmat—therefore; parokse—in some future time; asmat—my; upasrutani—about the qualities spoken of; alam—sufficiently; karisyatha—you will be able to offer; stotram—prayers; apicya-vacah—O gentle reciters; sati—being the proper engagement; uttama-sloka—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; guna—of the qualities; anuvade—discussion; jugupsitam—to an abominable person; na—never; stavayanti—offer prayers; sabhyah—persons who are gentle.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O gentle reciters, offer such prayers in due course of time, when the qualities of which you have spoken actually manifest themselves in me.</p>
<p>The gentle who offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not attribute such qualities to a human being, who does not actually have them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Gentle devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead know perfectly well who is God and who is not.</p>
<p>Nondevotee impersonalists, however, who have no idea what God is and who never offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are always interested in accepting a human being as God and offering such prayers to him.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a devotee and a demon.</p>
<p>Demons manufacture their own gods, or a demon himself claims to be God, following in the footsteps of Ravana and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Although Prthu Maharaja was factually an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he rejected those praises because the qualities of the Supreme Person were not yet manifest in him.</p>
<p>He wanted to stress that one who does not actually possess these qualities should not try to engage his followers and devotees in offering him glory for them, even though these qualities might be manifest in the future.</p>
<p>If a man who does not factually possess the attributes of a great personality engages his followers in praising him with the expectation that such attributes will develop in the future, that sort of praise is actually an insult.</p>

<p>mahad-gunan atmani kartum isah</p>
<p>kah stavakaih stavayate ’sato ’pi</p>
<p>te ’syabhavisyann iti vipralabdho</p>
<p>janavahasam kumatir na veda</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mahat—exalted; gunan—the qualities; atmani—in himself; kartum—to manifest; isah—competent; kah—who; stavakaih—by followers; stavayate—causes to be praised; asatah—not existing; api—although; te—they; asya—of him; abhavisyan—might have been; iti—thus; vipralabdhah—cheated; jana—of people; avahasam—insult; kumatih—a fool; na—does not; veda—know.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>How could an intelligent man competent enough to possess such exalted qualities allow his followers to praise him if he did not actually have them? Praising a man by saying that if he were educated he might have become a great scholar or great personality is nothing but a process of cheating.</p>
<p>A foolish person who agrees to accept such praise does not know that such words simply insult him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prthu Maharaja was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Lord Brahma and other demigods had already testified when they had presented the King with many heavenly gifts.</p>
<p>Because he had just been coronated, however, he could not manifest his godly qualities in action.</p>
<p>Therefore he was not willing to accept the praise of the devotees.</p>
<p>So-called incarnations of Godhead should therefore take lessons from the behavior of King Prthu.</p>
<p>Demons without godly qualities should not accept false praise from their followers.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Prthu continued: My dear devotees, headed by the suta, just now I am not very famous for my personal activities because I have not done anything praiseworthy you could glorify.</p>
<p>Therefore how could I engage you in praising my activities exactly like children?</p>
