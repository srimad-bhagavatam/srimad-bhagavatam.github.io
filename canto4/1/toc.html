<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Maitreya said: Svayambhuva Manu begot three daughters in his wife Satarupa, and their names were Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>First of all let us offer our respectful obeisances unto our spiritual master, Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada, by whose order I am engaged in this herculean task of writing commentary on the Srimad-Bhagavatam as the Bhaktivedanta purports.</p>
<p>By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying to begin the Fourth Canto.</p>
<p>By his divine grace let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this Krsna consciousness movement of Bhagavata-dharma five hundred years ago, and through His grace let us offer our obeisances to the six Gosvamis, and then let us offer our obeisances to Radha and Krsna, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally in Vrndavana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabhumi.</p>
<p>Let us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In this Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam there are thirty-one chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahma and the Manus.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahma, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In the First Chapter of this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of Svayambhuva Manu and their descendants.</p>
<p>The next six chapters describe the sacrifice performed by King Daksa and how it was spoiled.</p>
<p>Thereafter the activities of Maharaja Dhruva are described in five chapters.</p>
<p>Then, in eleven chapters, the activities of King Prthu are described, and the next eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Praceta kings.</p>
<p>As described in the first verse of this chapter, Svayambhuva Manu had three daughters, named Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti.</p>
<p>Of these three daughters, one daughter, Devahuti, has already been described, along with her husband, Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni.</p>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of the first daughter, Akuti, will specifically be described.</p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu was the son of Brahma.</p>
<p>Brahma had many other sons, but Manu’s name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Svayambhuva Manu also had two sons.</p>
