<h1>Genealogical Table of the Daughters of Manu</h1>
<p><strong>4.1.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>manos tu satarupayam</p>
<p>tisrah kanyas ca jajnire</p>
<p>akutir devahutis ca</p>
<p>prasutir iti visrutah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—the great sage Maitreya said; manoh tu—of Svayambhuva Manu; satarupayam—in his wife Satarupa; tisrah—three; kanyah ca—daughters also; jajnire—gave birth; akutih—named Akuti; devahutih—named Devahuti; ca—also; prasutih—named Prasuti; iti—thus; visrutah—well known.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Maitreya said: Svayambhuva Manu begot three daughters in his wife Satarupa, and their names were Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>First of all let us offer our respectful obeisances unto our spiritual master, Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada, by whose order I am engaged in this herculean task of writing commentary on the Srimad-Bhagavatam as the Bhaktivedanta purports.</p>
<p>By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying to begin the Fourth Canto.</p>
<p>By his divine grace let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this Krsna consciousness movement of Bhagavata-dharma five hundred years ago, and through His grace let us offer our obeisances to the six Gosvamis, and then let us offer our obeisances to Radha and Krsna, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally in Vrndavana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabhumi.</p>
<p>Let us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In this Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam there are thirty-one chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahma and the Manus.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahma, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In the First Chapter of this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of Svayambhuva Manu and their descendants.</p>
<p>The next six chapters describe the sacrifice performed by King Daksa and how it was spoiled.</p>
<p>Thereafter the activities of Maharaja Dhruva are described in five chapters.</p>
<p>Then, in eleven chapters, the activities of King Prthu are described, and the next eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Praceta kings.</p>
<p>As described in the first verse of this chapter, Svayambhuva Manu had three daughters, named Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti.</p>
<p>Of these three daughters, one daughter, Devahuti, has already been described, along with her husband, Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni.</p>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of the first daughter, Akuti, will specifically be described.</p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu was the son of Brahma.</p>
<p>Brahma had many other sons, but Manu’s name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this verse there is also the word ca, indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Svayambhuva Manu also had two sons.</p>



<p><strong>4.1.2</strong></p>
<p>akutim rucaye pradad</p>
<p>api bhratrmatim nrpah</p>
<p>putrika-dharmam asritya</p>
<p>satarupanumoditah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>akutim—Akuti; rucaye—unto the great sage Ruci; pradat—handed over; api—although; bhratr-matim—daughter having a brother; nrpah—the King; putrika—get the resultant son; dharmam—religious rites; asritya—taking shelter; satarupa—by the wife of Svayambhuva Manu; anumoditah—being sanctioned.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Akuti had two brothers, but in spite of her brothers, King Svayambhuva Manu handed her over to Prajapati Ruci on the condition that the son born of her be returned to Manu as his son.</p>
<p>This he did in consultation with his wife, Satarupa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a sonless person offers his daughter to a husband on the condition that his grandson be returned to him to be adopted as his son and inherit his property.</p>
<p>This is called putrika-dharma, which means that by execution of religious rituals one gets a son, although one is sonless by one’s own wife.</p>
<p>But here we see extraordinary behavior in Manu, for in spite of his having two sons, he handed over his first daughter to Prajapati Ruci on the condition that the son born of his daughter be returned to him as his son.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments in this connection that King Manu knew that the Supreme Personality of Godhead would take birth in the womb of Akuti; therefore, in spite of having two sons, he wanted the particular son born of Akuti because he was ambitious to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear as his son and grandson.</p>
<p>Manu is the lawgiver of mankind, and since he personally executed the putrika-dharma, we may accept that such a system may be adopted by mankind also.</p>
<p>Thus, even though one has a son, if one wants to have a particular son from one’s daughter, one may give one’s daughter in charity on that condition.</p>
<p>That is the opinion of Srila Jiva Gosvami.</p>



<p><strong>4.1.3</strong></p>
<p>prajapatih sa bhagavan</p>
<p>rucis tasyam ajijanat</p>
<p>mithunam brahma-varcasvi</p>
<p>paramena samadhina</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prajapatih—one who is entrusted with begetting children; sah—he; bhagavan—the most opulent; rucih—the great sage Ruci; tasyam—in her; ajijanat—gave birth; mithunam—couple; brahma-varcasvi—spiritually very much powerful; paramena—with great strength; samadhina—in trance.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Ruci, who was very powerful in his brahminical qualifications and was appointed one of the progenitors of the living entities, begot one son and one daughter by his wife, Akuti.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word brahma-varcasvi is very significant.</p>
<p>Ruci was a brahmana, and he executed the brahminical duties very rigidly.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses, control of the mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and material knowledge, simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, etc.</p>
<p>There are many qualities which indicate a brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the brahminical principles rigidly.</p>
<p>Therefore he is specifically mentioned as brahma-varcasvi.</p>
<p>One who is born of a brahmana father but does not act as a brahmana is called, in Vedic language, a brahma-bandhu, and is calculated to be on the level of sudras and women.</p>
<p>Thus in the Bhagavatam we find that Mahabharata was specifically compiled by Vyasadeva for stri-sudra-brahma-bandhu.</p>
<p>Stri means women, sudra means the lower class of civilized human society, and brahma-bandhu means persons who are born in the families of brahmanas but do not follow the rules and regulations carefully.</p>
<p>All of these three classes are called less intelligent; they have no access to the study of the Vedas, which are specifically meant for persons who have acquired the brahminical qualifications.</p>
<p>This restriction is based not upon any sectarian distinction but upon qualification.</p>
<p>The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed the brahminical qualifications.</p>
<p>It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have no brahminical qualifications and have never been trained under a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures like the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other puranas, for such persons cannot deliver their real message.</p>
<p>Ruci was considered a first-class brahmana; therefore he is mentioned here as brahma-varcasvi, one who had full prowess in brahminical strength.</p>



<p><strong>4.1.4</strong></p>
<p>yas tayoh purusah saksad</p>
<p>visnur yajna-svarupa-dhrk</p>
<p>ya stri sa daksina bhuter</p>
<p>amsa-bhutanapayini</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—one who; tayoh—out of them; purusah—male; saksat—directly; visnuh—the Supreme Lord; yajna—Yajna; svarupa-dhrk—accepting the form; ya—the other; stri—female; sa—she; daksina—Daksina; bhuteh—of the goddess of fortune; amsa-bhuta—being a plenary expansion; anapayini—never to be separated.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Of the two children born of Akuti, the male child was directly an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His name was Yajna, which is another name of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>The female child was a partial incarnation of Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, the eternal consort of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is the eternal consort of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Here it is stated that both the Lord and Laksmi, who are eternal consorts, appeared from Akuti simultaneously.</p>
<p>Both the Lord and His consort are beyond this material creation, as confirmed by many authorities (narayanah paro ’vyaktat); therefore their eternal relationship cannot be changed, and Yajna, the boy born of Akuti, later married the goddess of fortune.</p>



<p><strong>4.1.5</strong></p>
<p>aninye sva-grham putryah</p>
<p>putram vitata-rocisam</p>
<p>svayambhuvo muda yukto</p>
<p>rucir jagraha daksinam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aninye—brought to; sva-grham—home; putryah—born of the daughter; putram—the son; vitata-rocisam—very powerful; svayambhuvah—the Manu named Svayambhuva; muda—being very pleased; yuktah—with; rucih—the great sage Ruci; jagraha—kept; daksinam—the daughter named Daksina.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu very gladly brought home the beautiful boy named Yajna, and Ruci, his son-in-law, kept with him the daughter, Daksina.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu was very glad to see that his daughter Akuti had given birth to both a boy and girl.</p>
<p>He was afraid that he would take one son and that because of this his son-in-law Ruci might be sorry.</p>
<p>Thus when he heard that a daughter was born along with the boy, he was very glad.</p>
<p>Ruci, according to his promise, returned his male child to Svayambhuva Manu and decided to keep the daughter, whose name was Daksina.</p>
<p>One of Lord Visnu’s names is Yajna because He is the master of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The name Yajna comes from yajusam patih, which means Lord of all sacrifices In the Yajur Veda there are different ritualistic prescriptions for performing yajnas, and the beneficiary of all such yajnas is the Supreme Lord, Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore it is stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmanah: one should act, but one should perform one’s prescribed duties only for the sake of Yajna, or Visnu.</p>
<p>If one does not act for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if one does not perform devotional service, then there will be reactions to all one’s activities.</p>
<p>It does not matter if the reaction is good or bad; if our activities are not dovetailed with the desire of the Supreme Lord, or if we do not act in Krsna consciousness, then we shall be responsible for the results of all our activities.</p>
<p>There is always a reaction to every kind of action, but if actions are performed for Yajna, there is no reaction.</p>
<p>Thus if one acts for Yajna, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is not entangled in the material condition, for it is mentioned in the Vedas and also in Bhagavad-gita that the Vedas and the Vedic rituals are all meant for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>From the very beginning one should try to act in Krsna consciousness; that will free one from the reactions of material activities.</p>



<p><strong>4.1.6</strong></p>
<p>tam kamayanam bhagavan</p>
<p>uvaha yajusam patih</p>
<p>tustayam tosam apanno</p>
<p>’janayad dvadasatmajan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tam—her; kamayanam—desiring; bhagavan—the Lord; uvaha—married; yajusam—of all sacrifices; patih—master; tustayam—in His wife, who was very much pleased; tosam—great pleasure; apannah—having obtained; ajanayat—gave birth; dvadasa—twelve; atmajan—sons.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord of the ritualistic performance of yajna later married Daksina, who was anxious to have the Personality of Godhead as her husband, and in this wife the Lord was also very much pleased to beget twelve children.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>An ideal husband and wife are generally called Laksmi-Narayana to compare them to the Lord and the goddess of fortune, for it is significant that Laksmi-Narayana are forever happy as husband and wife.</p>
<p>A wife should always remain satisfied with her husband, and a husband should always remain satisfied with his wife.</p>
<p>In the Canakya-sloka, the moral instructions of Canakya Pandita, it is said that if a husband and wife are always satisfied with one another, then the goddess of fortune automatically comes.</p>
<p>In other words, where there is no disagreement between husband and wife, all material opulence is present, and good children are born.</p>
<p>Generally, according to Vedic civilization, the wife is trained to be satisfied in all conditions, and the husband, according to Vedic instruction, is required to please the wife with sufficient food, ornaments and clothing.</p>
<p>Then, if they are satisfied with their mutual dealings, good children are born.</p>
<p>In this way the entire world can become peaceful, but unfortunately in this age of Kali there are no ideal husbands and wives; therefore unwanted children are produced, and there is no peace and prosperity in the present-day world.</p>

<p>These six kinds of living entities are known as manus, devas, manu-putras, amsavataras, suresvaras and rsis.</p>

<p>atreh patny anasuya trin</p>
<p>jajne suyasasah sutan</p>
<p>dattam durvasasam somam</p>
<p>atmesa-brahma-sambhavan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>atreh—of Atri Muni; patni—wife; anasuya—named Anasuya; trin—three; jajne—bore; su-yasasah—very famous; sutan—sons; dattam—Dattatreya; durvasasam—Durvasa; somam—Soma (the moon-god); atma—the Supersoul; isa—Lord Siva; brahma—Lord Brahma; sambhavan—incarnations of.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Anasuya, the wife of Atri Muni, gave birth to three very famous sons—Soma, Dattatreya and Durvasa—who were partial representations of Lord Visnu, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Soma was a partial representation of Lord Brahma, Dattatreya was a partial representation of Lord Visnu, and Durvasa was a partial representation of Lord Siva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse we find the words atma-isa-brahma-sambhavan.</p>
<p>Atma means the Supersoul, or Visnu, isa means Lord Siva, and brahma means the four-headed Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>The three sons born of Anasuya—Dattatreya, Durvasa and Soma—were born as partial representations of these three demigods.</p>
<p>Atma is not in the category of the demigods or living entities because He is Visnu; therefore He is described as vibhinnamsa-bhutanam.</p>
<p>The Supersoul, Visnu, is the seed-giving father of all living entities, including Brahma and Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Another meaning of the word atma may be accepted in this way: the principle who is the Supersoul in every atma, or, one may say, the soul of everyone, became manifested as Dattatreya, because the word amsa, part and parcel, is used here.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the individual souls are also described as parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Supersoul, so why not accept that Dattatreya was one of those parts? Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are also described here as parts, so why not accept all of them as ordinary individual souls? The answer is that the manifestations of Visnu and those of the ordinary living entities are certainly all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to Him, but among the parts and parcels there are different categories.</p>
<p>In the Varaha Purana it is nicely explained that some of the parts are svamsa and some are vibhinnamsa.</p>
<p>Vibhinnamsa parts are called jivas, and svamsa parts are in the Visnu category.</p>
<p>In the jiva category, the vibhinnamsa parts and parcels, there are also gradations.</p>
<p>That is explained in the Visnu Purana, where it is clearly stated that the individual parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord are subject to being covered by the external energy, called illusion, or maya.</p>
<p>Such individual parts and parcels, who can travel to any part of the Lord’s creation, are called sarva-gata and are suffering the pangs of material existence.</p>
<p>They are proportionately freed from the coverings of ignorance under material existence according to different levels of work and under different influences of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>For example, the sufferings of jivas situated in the mode of goodness are less than those of jivas situated in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>Pure Krsna consciousness, however, is the birthright of all living entities because every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The consciousness of the Lord is also in the part and parcel, and according to the proportion to which that consciousness is cleared of material dirt, the living entities are differently situated.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutra, the living entities of different gradations are compared to candles or lamps with different candle power.</p>
<p>For example, some electric bulbs have the power of one thousand candles, some have the power of five hundred candles, some the power of one hundred candles, some fifty candles, etc., but all electric bulbs have light.</p>
<p>Light is present in every bulb, but the gradations of light are different.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are gradations of Brahman.</p>
<p>The Visnu svamsa expansions of the Supreme Lord in different Visnu forms are like lamps, Lord Siva is also like a lamp, and the supreme candle power, or the one-hundred-percent light, is Krsna.</p>
<p>The visnu-tattva has ninety-four percent, the siva-tattva has eighty-four percent, Lord Brahma has seventy-eight percent, and the living entities are also like Brahma, but in the conditioned state their power is still more dim.</p>
<p>There are gradations of Brahman, and no one can deny this fact.</p>
<p>Therefore the words atmesa-brahma-sambhavan indicate that Dattatreya was directly part and parcel of Visnu, whereas Durvasa and Soma were parts and parcels of Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After hearing this, Vidura inquired from Maitreya: My dear master, how is it that the three deities Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are the creator, maintainer and destroyer of the whole creation, became the offspring of the wife of Atri Muni?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The inquisitiveness of Vidura was quite fitting, for he understood that when the Supersoul, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva all appeared through the person of Anasuya, the wife of Atri Muni, there must have been some great purpose.</p>
<p>Otherwise why should they have appeared in such a way?</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He was thinking: May the Lord of the universe, of whom I have taken shelter, kindly he pleased to offer me a son exactly like Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that the great sage Atri Muni had no specific idea of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Of course, he must have been conversant with the Vedic information that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the creator of the universe, from whom everything emanated, who maintains this created manifestation, and in whom the entire manifestation is conserved after dissolution.</p>
<p>Yato va imani bhutani (Taittiriya Upanisad3.1.1).</p>
<p>The Vedic mantras give us information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so Atri Muni concentrated his mind upon that Supreme Personality of Godhead, even without knowing His name, just to beg from Him a child exactly on His level.</p>
<p>This kind of devotional service, in which knowledge of God’s name is lacking, is also described in Bhagavad-gita where the Lord says that four kinds of men with backgrounds of pious activities come to Him asking for what they need.</p>
<p>Atri Muni wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he is not supposed to have been a pure devotee, because he had a desire to be fulfilled, and that desire was material.</p>
<p>Although he wanted a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this desire was material because he did not want the Personality of Godhead Himself, but only a child exactly like Him.</p>
<p>If he had desired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material.</p>
<p>Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tapyamanam—while practicing austerities; tri-bhuvanam—the three worlds; pranayama—practice by breathing exercise; edhasa—fuel; agnina—by the fire; nirgatena—issuing out; muneh—of the great sage; murdhnah—the top of the head; samiksya—looking over; prabhavah trayah—the three great gods (Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While Atri Muni was engaged in these severe austerities, a blazing fire came out of his head by virtue of his breathing exercise, and that fire was seen by the three principal deities of the three worlds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, the fire of pranayama is mental satisfaction.</p>
<p>That fire was perceived by the Supersoul, Visnu, and thereby Lord Brahma and Siva also perceived it.</p>
<p>Atri Muni, by his breathing exercise, concentrated on the Supersoul, or the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord of the universe is Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti (Bg.7.19)), and, by the direction of Vasudeva, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva work.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the direction of Vasudeva, both Lord Brahma and Lord Siva perceived the severe penance adopted by Atri Muni, and thus they were pleased to come down, as stated in the next verse.</p>

<p>At that time, the three deities approached the hermitage of Atri Muni, accompanied by the denizens of the heavenly planets, such as the celestial beauties, the Gandharvas, the Siddhas, the Vidyadharas and the Nagas.</p>
<p>Thus they entered the asrama of the great sage, who had become famous by his austerities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is advised in the Vedic literatures that one should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Lord of the universe and the master of creation, maintenance and dissolution.</p>
<p>He is known as the Supersoul, and when one worships the Supersoul, all other deities, such as Brahma and Siva, appear with Lord Visnu because they are directed by the Supersoul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter he began to offer prayers to the three deities, who were seated on different carriers—a bull, a swan and Garuda—and who held in their hands a drum, kusa grass and a discus.</p>
<p>The sage offered them his respects by falling down like a stick.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Danda means a long rod and vat means like Before a superior, one has to fall down on the ground just like a stick, and this sort of offering of respect is called dandavat.</p>
<p>Atri Rsi offered his respect to the three deities in that way.</p>
<p>They were identified by their different carriers and different symbolic representations.</p>
<p>In that connection it is stated here that Lord Visnu was sitting on Garuda, a big aquiline bird, and was carrying in His hand a disc, Brahma was sitting on a swan and had in his hand kusa grass, and Lord Siva was sitting on a bull and carrying in his hand a small drum called a damaru.</p>
<p>Atri Rsi recognized them by their symbolic representations and different carriers, and thus he offered them prayers and respects.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since the deities were smiling, he could understand that they were pleased with him.</p>
<p>Their glaring bodily effulgence was intolerable to his eyes, so he closed them for the time being.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or other he gathered his senses, and with folded hands and sweet words he began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe.</p>
<p>The great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and Lord Siva, you have divided yourself into three bodies by accepting the three modes of material nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto all of you and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my prayer.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Atri Rsi called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, jagad-isvara, the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>The Lord must exist before the creation, otherwise how could He be its Lord? If someone constructs a big building, this indicates that he must have existed before the building was constructed.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Lord, the creator of the universe, must be transcendental to the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>But it is known that Visnu takes charge of the mode of goodness, Brahma takes charge of the mode of passion, and Lord Siva takes charge of the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore Atri Muni said, That jagad-isvara, the Lord of the universe, must be one of you, but since three of you have appeared, I cannot recognize whom I have called.</p>
<p>You are all so kind.</p>
<p>Please let me know who is actually jagad-isvara, the Lord of the universe In fact, Atri Rsi was doubtful about the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord, Visnu, but he was quite certain that the Lord of the universe cannot be one of the creatures created by maya.</p>
<p>His very inquiry about whom he had called indicates that he was in doubt about the constitutional position of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore he prayed to all three, Kindly let me know who is the transcendental Lord of the universe He was certain, of course, that not all of them could he the Lord, but the Lord of the universe was one of the three.</p>

<p>But although He is far beyond the mental speculation of man, all three of you have come here.</p>
<p>Kindly let me know how you have come, for I am greatly bewildered about this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Atri Muni was confidently aware that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the universe, so he prayed for the one Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He was surprised, therefore, that three of them appeared.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya continued: Upon hearing Atri Muni speak in that way, the three great deities smiled, and they replied in the following sweet words.</p>



<p><strong>4.1.30</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>devah ucuh—the demigods replied; yatha—as; krtah—done; te—by you; sankalpah—determination; bhavyam—to be done; tena eva—by that; na anyatha—not otherwise; sat-sankalpasya—one whose determination is never lost; te—of you; brahman—O dear brahmana; yat—that which; vai—certainly; dhyayati—meditating; te—all of them; vayam—we are.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The three deities told Atri Muni: Dear brahmana, you are perfect in your determination, and therefore as you have decided, so it will happen; it will not happen otherwise.</p>
<p>We are all the same person upon whom you were meditating, and therefore we have all come to you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Atri Muni unspecifically thought of the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, although he had no clear idea of the Lord of the universe nor of His specific form.</p>
<p>Maha-Visnu, from whose breathing millions of universes emanate and into whom they are again withdrawn, may be accepted as the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>Garbhodakasayi Visnu, from whose abdomen sprouted the lotus flower which is the birthplace of Brahma, may also be considered the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is the Supersoul of all living entities, may also be considered the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>Then, under the order of Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Visnu form within this universe, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva may also be accepted as the Lords of the universe.</p>
<p>Visnu is the Lord of the universe because He is its maintainer.</p>
<p>Similarly, Brahma creates the different planetary systems and the population, so he also may be considered the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>Or Lord Siva, who is ultimately the destroyer of the universe, also may be considered its Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, since Atri Muni did not specifically mention whom he wanted, all three—Brahma, Visnu and Lord Siva—came before him.</p>
<p>They said, Since you were thinking of having a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, your determination will be fulfilled In other words, one’s determination is fulfilled according to the strength of one’s devotion.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.25): yanti deva-vrata devan pitrn yanti pitr-vratah.</p>
<p>If one is attached to a particular demigod, one is promoted to the abode of that demigod; if one is attached to the Pitas, or forefathers, one is promoted to their planet; and similarly if one is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, one is promoted to the abode of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Atri Muni had no clear conception of the Lord of the universe; therefore the three presiding deities who are actually the lords of the universe in the three departments of the modes of nature all came before him.</p>
<p>Now, according to the strength of his determination for a son, his desire would be fulfilled by the grace of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demigods said: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the transcendental Personality of Godhead, who created as His external energy this cosmic manifestation, which is situated in Him as the air and clouds are situated in space, and who has now appeared in the form of Nara-Narayana Rsi in the house of Dharma.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The universal form of the Lord is the cosmic manifestation, which is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In space there are innumerable varieties of planets and also the air, and in the air there are variously colored clouds, and sometimes we see airplanes running from one place to another.</p>
<p>Thus the entire cosmic manifestation is full of variety, but actually that variety is a manifestation of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and that energy is situated in Him.</p>
<p>Now the Lord Himself, after manifesting His energy, appeared within the creation of His energy, which is simultaneously one with and different from Himself, and therefore the demigods offered their respects to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who manifests Himself in such varieties.</p>
<p>There are some philosophers, called nondualists, who because of their impersonal conception think that varieties are false.</p>
<p>In this verse it is specifically stated, yo mayaya viracitam.</p>
<p>This indicates that the varieties are a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus because the energy is nondifferent from the Godhead, the varieties are also factual.</p>
<p>The material varieties may be temporary, but they are not false.</p>
<p>They are a reflection of the spiritual varieties.</p>
<p>Here the word praticaksanaya, there are varieties announces the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as Nara-Narayana Rsi and who is the origin of all varieties of material nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Let that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is understood by truly authorized Vedic literature and who has created peace and prosperity to destroy all calamities of the created world, be kind enough to bestow His glance upon the demigods.</p>
<p>His merciful glance can supersede the beauty of the spotless lotus flower which is the home of the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of the cosmic manifestation, is covered by the wonderful activities of material nature, just as outer space or the illumination of the sun and moon is sometimes covered by clouds or dust.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find the origin of the cosmic manifestation; therefore material scientists conclude that nature is the ultimate cause of all manifestations.</p>
<p>But from sastra, or authentic literature like Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic scriptures, we understand that behind this wonderful cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in order to maintain the regular procedures of the cosmic manifestation and to be visible to the eyes of persons who are in the mode of goodness, the Lord appears.</p>
<p>He is the cause of the creation and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>The demigods therefore prayed for His merciful glance upon them in order to be blessed.</p>

<p>Narayana is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Nara is a part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana.</p>
<p>Thus the energy and the energetic together are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Maitreya informed Vidura that Nara, the portion of Narayana, had appeared in the family of the Kurus and that Narayana, the plenary expansion of Krsna, had come as Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with the purpose of delivering suffering humanity from the pangs of material burdens.</p>
<p>In other words, Narayana Rsi was now present in the world in the forms of Krsna and Arjuna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The reason is that Sati’s father, Daksa, used to rebuke Lord Siva in spite of Siva’s faultlessness.</p>
<p>Consequently, before attaining a mature age, Sati gave up her body by dint of yogic mystic power.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Siva, being the head of all mystic yogis, never even constructed a home for his residence.</p>
<p>Sati was the daughter of a great king, Daksa, and because his youngest daughter, Sati, selected as her husband Lord Siva, King Daksa was not very much satisfied with her.</p>
<p>Therefore whenever she met her father, he unnecessarily criticized her husband, although Lord Siva was faultless.</p>
<p>Because of this, before attaining a mature age Sati gave up the body given by her father, Daksa, and therefore she could not produce a child.</p>
