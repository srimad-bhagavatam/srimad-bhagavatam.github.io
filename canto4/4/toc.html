<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sage Maitreya said: Lord Siva was silent after speaking to Sati, seeing her between decisions.</p>
<p>Sati was very much anxious to see her relatives at her father’s house, but at the same time she was afraid of Lord Siva’s warning.</p>
<p>Her mind unsettled, she moved in and out of the room as a swing moves this way and that.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sati’s mind was divided about whether to go to her father’s house or obey the orders of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>The struggle between the two decisions was so strong that she was pushed from one side of the room to another, and she began to move just like the pendulum of a clock.</p>
