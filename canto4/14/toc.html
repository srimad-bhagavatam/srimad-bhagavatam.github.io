<p>pasyantah pasu-samyatam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—the great sage Maitreya continued; bhrgu-adayah—headed by Bhrgu; te—all of them; munayah—the great sages; lokanam—of the people; ksema-darsinah—who always aspire for the welfare; goptari—the King; asati—being absent; vai—certainly; nrnam—of all the citizens; pasyantah—having understood; pasu-samyatam—existence on the level of the animals.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Maitreya continued: O great hero Vidura, the great sages, headed by Bhrgu, were always thinking of the welfare of the people in general.</p>
<p>When they saw that in the absence of King Anga there was no one to protect the interests of the people, they understood that without a ruler the people would become independent and nonregulated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the significant word is ksema-darsinah, which refers to those who are always looking after the welfare of the people in general.</p>
<p>All the great sages headed by Bhrgu were always thinking of how to elevate all the people of the universe to the spiritual platform.</p>
<p>Indeed, they advised the kings of every planet to rule the people with that ultimate goal of life in mind.</p>
<p>The great sages used to advise the head of the state, or the king, and he used to rule the populace in accordance with their instruction.</p>
<p>After the disappearance of King Anga, there was no one to follow the instructions of the great sages.</p>
<p>Consequently all the citizens became unruly, so much so that they could be compared to animals.</p>
<p>As described in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), human society must be divided into four orders according to quality and work.</p>
<p>In every society there must be an intelligent class, administrative class, productive class and worker class.</p>
<p>In modern democracy these scientific divisions are turned topsy-turvy, and by vote sudras, or workers, are chosen for administrative posts.</p>
<p>Having no knowledge of the ultimate goal of life, such persons whimsically enact laws without knowledge of life’s purpose.</p>
<p>The result is that no one is happy.</p>
