<p>After describing the life and character of Maharaja Prthu in the previous chapter, the great sage Maitreya began to speak about the sons and grandsons in the genealogical line of the Prthu dynasty.</p>
<p>After the death of Maharaja Prthu, his eldest son, Vijitasva, became emperor of the world.</p>
<p>King Vijitasva was very affectionate toward his younger brothers, and therefore he wanted them to rule different directions of the world.</p>
