<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Vidura inquired: Why was Daksa, who was so affectionate towards his daughter, envious of Lord Siva, who is the best among the gentle? Why did he neglect his daughter Sati?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Second Chapter of the Fourth Canto, the cause of the dissension between Lord Siva and Daksa, which was due to a great sacrifice arranged by Daksa for the pacification of the entire universe, is explained.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is described here as the best of the gentle because he is not envious of anyone, he is equal to all living entities, and all other good qualities are present in his personality.</p>
<p>The word siva means all auspicious No one can be an enemy of Lord Siva’s, for he is so peaceful and renounced that he does not even construct a house for his residence, but lives underneath a tree, always detached from all worldly things.</p>
<p>The personality of Lord Siva symbolizes the best of gentleness.</p>
<p>Why, then, was Daksa, who offered his beloved daughter to such a gentle personality, inimical towards Lord Siva so intensely that Sati, the daughter of Daksa and wife of Lord Siva, gave up her body?</p>
