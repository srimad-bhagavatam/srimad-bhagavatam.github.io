<h1>Frustration of the Sacrifice of Daksa</h1>
<p><strong>4.5.1</strong></p>
<p>maitreya uvaca</p>
<p>bhavo bhavanya nidhanam prajapater</p>
<p>asat-krtaya avagamya naradat</p>
<p>sva-parsada-sainyam ca tad-adhvararbhubhir</p>
<p>vidravitam krodham aparam adadhe</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—Maitreya said; bhavah—Lord Siva; bhavanyah—of Sati; nidhanam—the death; prajapateh—because of Prajapati Daksa; asat-krtayah—having been insulted; avagamya—hearing about; naradat—from Narada; sva-parsada-sainyam—the soldiers of his own associates; ca—and; tat-adhvara—(produced from) his (Daksa’s) sacrifice; rbhubhih—by the Rbhus; vidravitam—were driven away; krodham—anger; aparam—unbounded; adadhe—showed.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maitreya said: When Lord Siva heard from Narada that Sati, his wife, was now dead because of Prajapati Daksa’s insult to her and that his soldiers had been driven away by the Rbhu demigods, he became greatly angry.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Siva understood that Sati, being the youngest daughter of Daksa, could present the case of Lord Siva’s purity of purpose and would thus be able to mitigate the misunderstanding between Daksa and himself.</p>
<p>But such a compromise was not attained, and Sati was deliberately insulted by her father by not being received properly when she visited his house without being invited.</p>
<p>Sati herself could have killed her father, Daksa, because she is the personified material energy and has immense power to kill and create within this material universe.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita her strength is described: she is capable of creating and dissolving many universes.</p>
<p>But although she is so powerful, she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, as His shadow.</p>
<p>It would not have been difficult for Sati to punish her father, but she thought that since she was his daughter, it was not proper for her to kill him.</p>
<p>Thus she decided to give up her own body, which she had obtained from his, and Daksa did not even check her.</p>
<p>When Sati passed away, giving up her body, the news was conveyed by Narada to Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Narada always carries the news of such events because he knows their import.</p>
<p>When Lord Siva heard that his chaste wife, Sati, was dead, he naturally became exceedingly angry.</p>
<p>He also understood that Bhrgu Muni had created the Rbhudeva demigods by uttering the mantras of the Yajur Veda and that these demigods had driven away all of his soldiers who were present in the arena of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Therefore, he wanted to reply to this insult, and thus he decided to kill Daksa because he was the cause of the death of Sati.</p>

<p>He stood up at once, laughing like a madman, and dashed the hair to the ground.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p>He had thousands of arms, equipped with various weapons, and he was garlanded with the heads of men.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.4</strong></p>
<p>tam kim karomiti grnantam aha</p>
<p>baddhanjalim bhagavan bhuta-nathah</p>
<p>daksam sa-yajnam jahi mad-bhatanam</p>
<p>tvam agrani rudra bhatamsako me</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tam—to him (Virabhadra); kim—what; karomi—shall I do; iti—thus; grnantam—asking; aha—ordered; baddha-anjalim—with folded hands; bhagavan—the possessor of all opulences (Lord Siva); bhuta-nathah—the lord of the ghosts; daksam—Daksa; sa-yajnam—along with his sacrifice; jahi—kill; mat-bhatanam—of all my associates; tvam—you; agranih—the chief; rudra—O Rudra; bhata—O expert in battle; amsakah—born of my body; me—my.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When that gigantic demon asked with folded hands, What shall I do, my lord Lord Siva, who is known as Bhutanatha, directly ordered, Because you are born from my body, you are the chief of all my associates.</p>
<p>Therefore, kill Daksa and his soldiers at the sacrifice</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is the beginning of competition between brahma-tejas and siva-tejas.</p>
<p>By brahma-tejas, brahminical strength, Bhrgu Muni had created the Rbhu demigods, who had driven away the soldiers of Lord Siva stationed in the arena.</p>
<p>When Lord Siva heard that his soldiers had been driven away, he created the tall black demon Virabhadra to retaliate.</p>
<p>There is sometimes a competition between the mode of goodness and the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>That is the way of material existence.</p>
<p>Even when one is situated in the mode of goodness, there is every possibility that his position will be mixed with or attacked by the mode of passion or ignorance.</p>
<p>That is the law of material nature.</p>
<p>Although pure goodness, or suddha-sattva, is the basic principle in the spiritual world, pure manifestation of goodness is not possible in this material world.</p>
<p>Thus, the struggle for existence between different material qualities is always present.</p>
<p>This quarrel between Lord Siva and Bhrgu Muni, centering around Prajapati Daksa, is the practical example of such competition between the different qualitative modes of material nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, that black person was the personified anger of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he was prepared to execute the orders of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Thus, considering himself capable of coping with any power offered against him, he circumambulated Lord Siva.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.6</strong></p>
<p>anviyamanah sa tu rudra-parsadair</p>
<p>bhrsam nadadbhir vyanadat subhairavam</p>
<p>udyamya sulam jagad-antakantakam</p>
<p>sampradravad ghosana-bhusananghrih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>anviyamanah—being followed; sah—he (Virabhadra); tu—but; rudra-parsadaih—by the soldiers of Lord Siva; bhrsam—tumultuously; nadadbhih—roaring; vyanadat—sounded; su-bhairavam—very fearful; udyamya—carrying; sulam—a trident; jagat-antaka—death; antakam—killing; sampradravat—hurried towards (the sacrifice of Daksa); ghosana—roaring; bhusana-anghrih—with bangles on his legs.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Many other soldiers of Lord Siva followed the fierce personality in a tumultuous uproar.</p>
<p>He carried a great trident, fearful enough to kill even death, and on his legs he wore bangles which seemed to roar.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.7</strong></p>
<p>athartvijo yajamanah sadasyah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At that time, all the persons assembled in the sacrificial arena—the priests, the chief of the sacrificial performance, and the brahmanas and their wives—wondered where the darkness was coming from.</p>
<p>Later they could understand that it was a dust storm, and all of them were full of anxiety.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.8</strong></p>
<p>vata na vanti na hi santi dasyavah</p>
<p>pracina-barhir jivati hogra-dandah</p>
<p>gavo na kalyanta idam kuto rajo</p>
<p>loko ’dhuna kim pralayaya kalpate</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vatah—the winds; na vanti—are not blowing; na—not; hi—because; santi—are possible; dasyavah—plunderers; pracina-barhih—old King Barhi; jivati—is living; ha—still; ugra-dandah—who would sternly punish; gavah—the cows; na kalyante—are not being driven; idam—this; kutah—from where; rajah—dust; lokah—the planet; adhuna—now; kim—is it; pralayaya—for dissolution; kalpate—to be considered ready.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Conjecturing on the origin of the storm, they said: There is no wind blowing, and no cows are passing, nor is it possible that this dust storm could be raised by plunderers, for there is still the strong King Barhi, who would punish them.</p>
<p>Where is this dust storm blowing from? Is the dissolution of the planet now to occur?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Specifically significant in this verse is pracina-barhir jivati.</p>
<p>The king of that part of the land was known as Barhi, and although he was old, he was still living, and he was a very strong ruler.</p>
<p>Thus there was no possibility of an invasion by thieves and plunderers.</p>
<p>Indirectly it is stated here that thieves, plunderers, rogues and unwanted population can exist only in a state or kingdom where there is no strong ruler.</p>
<p>When, in the name of justice, thieves are allowed liberty, the state and kingdom are disturbed by such plunderers and unwanted population.</p>
<p>The dust storm created by the soldiers and assistants of Lord Siva resembled the situation at the time of the dissolution of this world.</p>
<p>When there is a need for the dissolution of the material creation, this function is conducted by Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Therefore the situation now created by him resembled the dissolution of the cosmic manifestation.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.9</strong></p>
<p>prasuti-misrah striya udvigna-citta</p>
<p>ucur vipako vrjinasyaiva tasya</p>
<p>yat pasyantinam duhitrnam prajesah</p>
<p>sutam satim avadadhyav anagam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prasuti-misrah—headed by Prasuti; striyah—the women; udvigna-cittah—being very anxious; ucuh—said; vipakah—the resultant danger; vrjinasya—of the sinful activity; eva—indeed; tasya—his (Daksa’s); yat—because; pasyantinam—who were looking on; duhitrnam—of her sisters; prajesah—the lord of the created beings (Daksa); sutam—his daughter; satim—Sati; avadadhyau—insulted; anagam—completely innocent.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prasuti, the wife of Daksa, along with the other women assembled, became very anxious and said: This danger has been created by Daksa because of the death of Sati, who, even though completely innocent, quit her body as her sisters looked on.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prasuti, being a softhearted woman, could immediately understand that the imminent danger approaching was due to the impious activity of hardhearted Prajapati Daksa.</p>
<p>He was so cruel that he would not save her youngest daughter, Sati, from the act of committing suicide in the presence of her sisters.</p>
<p>Sati’s mother could understand how much Sati had been pained by the insult of her father.</p>
<p>Sati had been present along with the other daughters, and Daksa had purposely received all of them but her because she happened to be the wife of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>This consideration convinced the wife of Daksa of the danger which was now ahead, and thus she knew that Daksa must be prepared to die for his heinous act.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.10</strong></p>
<p>yas tv anta-kale vyupta-jata-kalapah</p>
<p>sva-sula-sucy-arpita-dig-gajendrah</p>
<p>vitatya nrtyaty uditastra-dor-dhvajan</p>
<p>uccatta-hasa-stanayitnu-bhinna-dik</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—who (Lord Siva); tu—but; anta-kale—at the time of dissolution; vyupta—having scattered; jata-kalapah—his bunch of hair; sva-sula—his own trident; suci—on the points; arpita—pierced; dik-gajendrah—the rulers of the different directions; vitatya—scattering; nrtyati—dances; udita—upraised; astra—weapons; doh—hands; dhvajan—flags; ucca—loud; atta-hasa—laughing; stanayitnu—by the thundering sound; bhinna—divided; dik—the directions.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At the time of dissolution, Lord Siva’s hair is scattered, and he pierces the rulers of the different directions with his trident.</p>
<p>He laughs and dances proudly, scattering their hands like flags, as thunder scatters the clouds all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prasuti, who appreciated the power and strength of her son-in-law, Lord Siva, is describing what he does at the time of dissolution.</p>
<p>This description indicates that the strength of Lord Siva is so great that Daksa’s power could not be set in comparison to it.</p>
<p>At the time of dissolution, Lord Siva, with his trident in hand, dances over the rulers of the different planets, and his hair is scattered, just as the clouds are scattered over all directions in order to plunge the different planets into incessant torrents of rain.</p>
<p>In the last phase of dissolution, all the planets become inundated with water, and that inundation is caused by the dancing of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>This dance is called the pralaya dance, or dance of dissolution.</p>
<p>Prasuti could understand that the dangers ahead resulted not only from Daksa’s having neglected her daughter, but also because of his neglecting the prestige and honor of Lord Siva.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.11</strong></p>
<p>amarsayitva tam asahya-tejasam</p>
<p>manyu-plutam durniriksyam bhru-kutya</p>
<p>karala-damstrabhir udasta-bhaganam</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>amarsayitva—after causing to become angry; tam—him (Lord Siva); asahya-tejasam—with an unbearable effulgence; manyu-plutam—filled with anger; durniriksyam—not able to be looked at; bhru-kutya—by the movement of his brows; karala-damstrabhih—by his fearful teeth; udasta-bhaganam—having scattered the luminaries; syat—there should be; svasti—good fortune; kim—how; kopayatah—causing (Lord Siva) to be angry; vidhatuh—of Brahma.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The gigantic black man bared his fearful teeth.</p>
<p>By the movements of his brows he scattered the luminaries all over the sky, and he covered them with his strong, piercing effulgence.</p>
<p>Because of the misbehavior of Daksa, even Lord Brahma, Daksa’s father, could not have been saved from the great exhibition of anger.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.12</strong></p>
<p>bahv evam udvigna-drsocyamane</p>

<p>utpetur utpatatamah sahasraso</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While all the people talked amongst themselves, Daksa saw dangerous omens from all sides, from the earth and from the sky.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse Daksa has been described as mahatma.</p>
<p>The word mahatma has been commented upon by different commentators in various manners.</p>
<p>Viraraghava Acarya has indicated that this word mahatma means steady in heart That is to say that Daksa was so stronghearted that even when his beloved daughter was prepared to lay down her life, he was steady and unshaken.</p>
<p>But in spite of his being so stronghearted, he was perturbed when he saw the various disturbances created by the gigantic black demon.</p>
<p>Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks in this connection that even if one is called mahatma, a great soul, unless he exhibits the symptoms of a mahatma, he should be considered a duratma, or a degraded soul.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.13) the word mahatma describes the pure devotee of the Lord: mahatmanas tu mam partha daivim prakrtim asritah.</p>
<p>A mahatma is always under the guidance of the internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus how could such a misbehaved person as Daksa be a mahatma? A mahatma is supposed to have all the good qualities of the demigods, and thus Daksa, lacking those qualities, could not be called a mahatma; he should instead be called duratma, a degraded soul.</p>
<p>The word mahatma to describe the qualifications of Daksa is used sarcastically.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear Vidura, all the followers of Lord Siva surrounded the arena of sacrifice.</p>
<p>They were of short stature and were equipped with various kinds of weapons; their bodies appeared to be like those of sharks, blackish and yellowish.</p>
<p>They ran all around the sacrificial arena and thus began to create disturbances.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just as Baladeva knocked out the teeth of Dantavakra, the King of Kalinga, during the gambling match at the marriage ceremony of Aniruddha, Virabhadra knocked out the teeth of both Daksa, who had shown them while cursing Lord Siva, and Pusa, who by smiling sympathetically had also shown his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here a reference is made to the marriage of Aniruddha, a grandson of Lord Krsna’s.</p>
<p>He kidnapped the daughter of Dantavakra, and thereafter he was arrested.</p>
<p>Just as he was to be punished for the kidnapping, the soldiers from Dvaraka arrived, headed by Balarama, and a fight ensued amongst the ksatriyas.</p>
<p>This sort of fight was very common, especially during marriage ceremonies, when everyone was in a challenging spirit.</p>
<p>In that challenging spirit, a fight was sure to occur, and in such fights there was commonly killing and misfortune.</p>
<p>After finishing such fighting, the parties would come to a compromise, and everything would be settled.</p>
<p>This Daksa yajna was similar to such events.</p>
<p>Now all of them—Daksa and the demigods Bhaga and Pusa and Bhrgu Muni—were punished by the soldiers of Lord Siva, but later everything would come to a peaceful end.</p>
<p>So this spirit of fighting between one another was not exactly inimical.</p>
<p>Because everyone was so powerful and wanted to show his strength by Vedic mantra or mystic power, all these fighting skills were very elaborately exhibited by the different parties at the Daksa yajna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then Virabhadra, the giantlike personality, sat on the chest of Daksa and tried to separate his head from his body with sharp weapons, but was unsuccessful.</p>



<p><strong>4.5.23</strong></p>
<p>sastrair astranvitair evam</p>
<p>anirbhinna-tvacam harah</p>

<p><strong>4.5.24</strong></p>
<p>drstva samjnapanam yogam</p>
<p>pasunam sa patir makhe</p>
<p>yajamana-pasoh kasya</p>
<p>kayat tenaharac chirah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then Virabhadra saw the wooden device in the sacrificial arena by which the animals were to have been killed.</p>
<p>He took the opportunity of this facility to behead Daksa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this connection it is to be noted that the device used for killing animals in the sacrifice was not designed to facilitate eating their flesh.</p>
<p>The killing was specifically intended to give a new life to the sacrificed animal by the power of Vedic mantra.</p>
<p>The animals were sacrificed to test the strength of Vedic mantras; yajnas were performed as a test of the mantra.</p>
<p>Even in the modern age, tests are executed on animal bodies in the physiology laboratory.</p>
<p>Similarly, whether or not the brahmanas were uttering the Vedic hymns correctly was tested by sacrifice in the arena.</p>
<p>On the whole, the animals thus sacrificed were not at all the losers.</p>
<p>Some old animals would be sacrificed, but in exchange for their old bodies they received other, new bodies.</p>
<p>That was the test of Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>Virabhadra, instead of sacrificing animals with the wooden device, immediately beheaded Daksa, to the astonishment of everyone.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Upon seeing the action of Virabhadra, the party of Lord Siva was pleased and cried out joyfully, and all the bhutas, ghosts and demons that had come made a tumultuous sound.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the brahmanas in charge of the sacrifice cried out in grief at the death of Daksa.</p>
