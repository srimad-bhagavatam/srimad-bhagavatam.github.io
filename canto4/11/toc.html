<p>maitreya uvaca</p>

<p>rsinam dhanusi dhruvah</p>
<p>sandadhe ’stram upasprsya</p>
<p>yan narayana-nirmitam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>maitreyah uvaca—the sage Maitreya continued to speak; nisamya—having heard; gadatam—the words; evam—thus; rsinam—of the sages; dhanusi—upon his bow; dhruvah—Dhruva Maharaja; sandadhe—fixed; astram—an arrow; upasprsya—after touching water; yat—that which; narayana—by Narayana; nirmitam—was made.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, when Dhruva Maharaja heard the encouraging words of the great sages, he performed the acamana by touching water and then took up his arrow made by Lord Narayana and fixed it upon his bow.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja was given a specific arrow made by Lord Narayana Himself, and he now fixed it upon his bow to finish the illusory atmosphere created by the Yaksas.</p>
<p>As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita (7.14), mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te.</p>
<p>Without Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one is able to overcome the action of the illusory energy.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has also given us a nice weapon for this age, as stated in the Bhagavatam: sangopangastra—in this age, the narayanastra, or weapon to drive away maya, is the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra in pursuance of the associates of Lord Caitanya, such as Advaita Prabhu, Nityananda, Gadadhara and Srivasa.</p>
