<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, I have thus far described the diameter of the universe (fifty crores of yojanas, or four billion miles) and its general characteristics, according to the estimations of learned scholars.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.2</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As a grain of wheat is divided into two parts and one can estimate the size of the upper part by knowing that of the lower, so, expert geographers instruct, one can understand the measurements of the upper part of the universe by knowing those of the lower part.</p>
<p>The sky between the earthly sphere and heavenly sphere is called antariksa, or outer space.</p>
<p>It adjoins the top of the sphere of earth and the bottom of that of heaven.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.3</strong></p>
<p>yan-madhya-gato bhagavams tapatam patis tapana atapena tri-lokim pratapaty avabhasayaty atma-bhasa sa esa udagayana-daksinayana-vaisuvata-samjnabhir mandya-saighrya-samanabhir gatibhir arohanavarohana-samana-sthanesu yatha-savanam abhipadyamano makaradisu rasisv aho-ratrani dirgha-hrasva-samanani vidhatte.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the midst of that region of outer space (antariksa) is the most opulent sun, the king of all the planes that emanate heat, such as the moon.</p>
<p>By the influence of its radiation, the sun heats the universe and maintains its proper order.</p>
<p>It also gives light to help all living entities see.</p>
<p>While passing toward the north, toward the south or through the equator, in accordance with the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is said to move slowly, swiftly or moderately.</p>
<p>According to its movements in rising above, going beneath or passing through the equator—and correspondingly coming in touch with various signs of the zodiac, headed by Makara (Capricorn)—days and nights are short, long or equal to one another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.52):</p>
<p>yac caksur esa savita sakala-grahanam</p>
<p>raja samasta-sura-murtir asesa-tejah</p>
<p>yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time.</p>
<p>The sun is the king of all planeary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light Although the sun is described as bhagavan, the most powerful, and although it is actually the most powerful planet within the universe, it nevertheless has to carry out the order of Govinda, Krsna.</p>
<p>The sun-god cannot deviate even an inch from the orbit designated to him.</p>
<p>Therefore in every sphere of life, the supreme order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is carried out.</p>
<p>The entire material nature carries out His orders.</p>
<p>However, we foolishly see the activities of material nature without understanding the supreme order and Supreme Person behind them.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, mayadhyaksena prakrtih: (Bg.9.10) material nature carries out the orders of the Lord, and thus everything is maintained in an orderly way.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.4</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>evam—thus; nava—nine; kotayah—ten millions; eka-pancasat—fifty-one; laksani—hundred thousands; yojananam—of the yojanas; manasottara-giri—of the mountain known as Manasottara; parivartanasya—of the circumambulation; upadisanti—they (learned scholars) teach; tasmin—on that (Manasottara Mountain); aindrim—of King Indra; purim—the city; purvasmat—on the eastern side; meroh—of Sumeru Mountain; devadhanim—Devadhani; nama—of the name; daksinatah—on the southern side; yamyam—of Yamaraja; samyamanim—Samyamani; nama—named; pascat—on the western side; varunim—of Varuna; nimlocanim—Nimlocani; nama—named; uttaratah—on the northern side; saumyam—of the moon; vibhavarim—Vibhavari; nama—named; tasu—in all of them; udaya—rising; madhyahna—midday; astamaya—sunset; nisithani—midnight; iti—thus; bhutanam—of the living entities; pravrtti—of activity; nivrtti—and cessation of activity; nimittani—the causes; samaya-visesena—by the particular times; meroh—of Sumeru Mountain; catuh-disam—the four sides.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued; My dear King, as stated before, the learned say that the sun travels over all sides of Manasottara Mountain in a circle whose length is 95,100,000 yojanas (760,800,000 miles).</p>
<p>On Manasottara Mountain, due east of Mount Sumeru, is a place known as Devadhani, possessed by King Indra.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the south is a place known as Samyamani, possessed by Yamaraja, in the west is a place known as Nimlocani, possessed by Varuna, and in the north is a place named Vibhavari, possessed by the moon-god.</p>
<p>Sunrise, midday, sunset and midnight occur in all those places according to specific times, thus engaging all living entities in their various occupational duties and also making them cease such duties.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.8-9</strong></p>
<p>tatratyanam divasa-madhyangata eva sadadityas tapati savyenacalam daksinena karoti; yatrodeti tasya ha samana-sutra-nipate nimlocati yatra kvacana syandenabhitapati tasya haisa samana-sutra-nipate prasvapayati tatra gatam na pasyanti ye tam samanupasyeran.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entities residing on Sumeru Mountain are always very warm, as at midday, because for them the sun is always overhead.</p>
<p>Although the sun moves counterclockwise, facing the constellations, with Sumeru Mountain on its left, it also moves clockwise and appears to have the mountain on its right because it is influenced by the daksinavarta wind.</p>
<p>People living in countries at points diametrically opposite to where the sun is first seen rising will see the sun setting, and if a straight line were drawn from a point where the sun is at midday, the people in countries at the opposite end of the line would be experiencing midnight.</p>
<p>Similarly, if people residing where the sun is setting were to go to countries diametrically opposite, they would not see the sun in the same condition.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.10</strong></p>
<p>yada caindryah puryah pracalate pancadasa-ghatikabhir yamyam sapada-koti-dvayam yojananam sardha-dvadasa-laksani sadhikani copayati.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The distance indicated by the word sadhikani is panca-vimsati-sahasradhikani, or 25,000 yojanas.</p>
<p>That plus two and a half crores and twelve and a half laksa of yojanas is the distance the sun travels between each two cities.</p>
<p>This comes to 23,775,000 yojanas, or 190,200,000 miles.</p>
<p>The total orbit of the sun is four times that distance, or 95,100,000 yojanas (760,800,000 miles).</p>



<p><strong>5.21.11</strong></p>
<p>evam tato varunim saumyam aindrim ca punas tathanye ca grahah somadayo naksatraih saha jyotis-cakre samabhyudyanti saha va nimlo-canti.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From the residence of Yamaraja the sun travels to Nimlocani, the residence of Varuna, from there to Vibhavari, the residence of the moon-god, and from there again to the residence of Indra.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the moon, along with the other stars and planes, becomes visible in the celestial sphere and then sets and again becomes invisible.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (10.21) Krsna says, naksatranam aham sasi: Of stars I am the moon This indicates that the moon is similar to the other stars.</p>
<p>The Vedic literature informs us that within this universe there is one sun, which is moving.</p>
<p>The Western theory that all the luminaries in the sky are different suns is not confirmed in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Nor can we assume that these luminaries are the suns of other universes, for each universe is covered by various layers of material elements, and therefore although the universes are clustered together, we cannot see from one universe to another.</p>
<p>In other words, whatever we see is within this one universe.</p>
<p>In each universe there is one Lord Brahma, and there are other demigods on other planes, but there is only one sun.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.12</strong></p>
<p>evam muhurtena catus-trimsal-laksa-yojanany asta-satadhikani sauro rathas trayimayo ’sau catasrsu parivartate purisu.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus the chariot of the sun-god, which is trayimaya, or worshiped by the words om bhur bhuvah svah, travels through the four residences mentioned above at a speed of 3,400,800 yojanas (27,206,400 miles) in a muhurta.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.13</strong></p>
<p>yasyaikam cakram dvadasaram san-nemi tri-nabhi samvatsaratmakam samamananti tasyakso meror murdhani krto manasottare krtetara-bhago yatra protam ravi-ratha-cakram taila-yantra-cakravad bhraman manasottara-girau paribhramati.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The chariot of the sun-god has only one wheel, which is known as Samvatsara.</p>
<p>The twelve months are calculated to be its twelve spokes, the six seasons are the sections of its rim, and the three catur-masya periods are its three-sectioned hub.</p>
<p>One side of the axle carrying the wheel rests upon the summit of Mount Sumeru, and the other rests upon Manasottara Mountain.</p>
<p>Affixed to the outer end of the axle, the wheel continuously rotates on Manasottara Mountain like the wheel of an oil-pressing machine.</p>



<p><strong>5.21.14</strong></p>
<p>tasminn akse krtamulo dvitiyo ’ksas turyamanena sammitas taila-yantraksavad dhruve krtopari-bhagah.</p>
