<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#525" id="525">5.25</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, Sukadeva Gosvami describes Ananta, the source of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Ananta, whose body is completely spiritual, resides at the root of the planet Patala.</p>
<p>He always lives in the core of Lord Siva’s heart, and He helps him destroy the universe.</p>
<p>Ananta instructs Lord Siva how to destroy the cosmos, and thus He is sometimes called tamasi, or one who is in the mode of darkness He is the original Deity of material consciousness, and because He attracts all living entities, He is sometimes known as Sankarsana.</p>
<p>The entire material world is situated on the hoods of Lord Sankarsana.</p>
<p>From His forehead He transmits to Lord Siva the power to destroy this material world.</p>
<p>Because Lord Sankarsana is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, many devotees offer Him prayers, and in the planetary system of Patala, all the suras, asuras, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas and learned sages offer Him their respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>The Lord talks with them in a sweet voice.</p>
<p>His bodily construction is completely spiritual and very, very beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyone who hears about Him from a proper spiritual master becomes free from all material conceptions of life.</p>
<p>The entire material energy is working according to the plans of Anantadeva.</p>
<p>Therefore we should regard Him as the root cause of the material creation.</p>
<p>There is no end to His strength, and no one can fully describe Him, even with countless mouths.</p>
<p>Therefore He is called Ananta (unlimited).</p>
<p>Being very merciful toward all living entities, He has exhibited His spiritual body.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami describes the glories of Anantadeva to Maharaja Pariksit in this way.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said to Maharaja Pariksit: My dear King, approximately 240,000 miles beneath the planet Patala lives another incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is the expansion of Lord Visnu known as Lord Ananta or Lord Sankarsana.</p>
<p>He is always in the transcendental position, but because He is worshiped by Lord Siva, the deity of tamo-guna or darkness, He is sometimes called tamasi.</p>
<p>Lord Ananta is the predominating Deity of the material mode of ignorance as well as the false ego of all conditioned souls.</p>
<p>When a conditioned living being thinks, I am the enjoyer, and this world is meant to be enjoyed by me this conception of life is dictated to him by Sankarsana.</p>
<p>Thus the mundane conditioned soul thinks himself the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is a class of men akin to Mayavadi philosophers who misinterpret the aham brahmasmi and so’ham Vedic mantras to mean, I am the Supreme Brahma and I am identical with the Lord This kind of false conception, in which one thinks himself the supreme enjoyer, is a kind of illusion.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.8): janasya moho ’yam aham mameti.</p>
<p>As explained in the above verse, Lord Sankarsana is the predominating Deity of this false conception.</p>
<p>Krsna confirms this in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):</p>
<p>sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto</p>
<p>mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca</p>
<p>I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart as Sankarsana, and when a demon thinks himself one with the Supreme Lord, the Lord keeps him in that darkness.</p>
<p>Although such a demoniac living entity is only an insignificant part of the Supreme Lord, he forgets his true position and thinks he is the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Because this forgetfulness is created by Sankarsana, He is sometimes called tamasi.</p>
<p>The name tamasi does not indicate that He has a material body.</p>
<p>He is always transcendental, but because He is the Supersoul of Lord Siva, who must perform tamasic activities, Sankarsana is sometimes called tamasi.</p>
