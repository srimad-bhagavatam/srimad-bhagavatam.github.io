<h1><a class="header" href="#the-activities-of-lord-rsabhadeva" id="the-activities-of-lord-rsabhadeva">The Activities of Lord Rsabhadeva</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#56" id="56">5.6</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter tells how Lord Rsabhadeva left His body.</p>
<p>He was not attached to His body even when it was being burned up in a forest fire.</p>
<p>When the seed of fruitive activity is burned by the fire of knowledge, the spiritual properties and mystic powers are automatically manifest, yet bhakti-yoga is not affected by these mystic powers.</p>
<p>An ordinary yogi is captivated by mystic powers and his progress checked; therefore a perfect yogi does not welcome them.</p>
<p>Because the mind is restless and undependable, it must remain always under control.</p>
<p>Even the mind of the advanced yogi Saubhari created such a disturbance that he lost his yogic mystic powers.</p>
<p>Due to a restless mind, even a very advanced yogi can fall down.</p>
<p>The mind is so restless that it induces even a perfect yogi to be controlled by the senses.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Rsabhadeva, for the instruction of all yogis, showed the process of quitting the body.</p>
<p>While traveling in South India, through the provinces of Karnata, Konka, Venka and Kutaka, Lord Rsabhadeva arrived in the neighborhood of Kutakacala.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a forest fire that burned the forest and Lord Rsabhadeva’s body to ashes.</p>
<p>The pastimes of Lord Rsabhadeva as a liberated soul were known by the King of Konka, Venka and Kutaka.</p>
<p>This King’s name was Arhat.</p>
<p>He later became captivated by the illusory energy, and in this condition he set forth the basic principles of Jainism.</p>
<p>Lord Rsabhadeva set forth the principles of religion that can free one from material bondage, and He put an end to all kinds of atheistic activities.</p>
<p>On this earth, the place known as Bharata-varsa was a very pious land because the Supreme Lord appeared there when He wanted to incarnate.</p>
<p>Lord Rsabhadeva neglected all the mystic powers for which the so-called yogis hanker.</p>
<p>Because of the beauty of devotional service, devotees are not at all interested in so-called mystic power.</p>
<p>The master of all yogic power, Lord Krsna, can exhibit all powers on behalf of His devotee.</p>
<p>Devotional service is more valuable than yogic mystic powers.</p>
<p>Devotees who are sometimes misled aspire for liberation and mystic powers.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord gives these devotees whatever they desire, but they cannot attain the most important function of devotional service.</p>
<p>Devotional service to the Lord is guaranteed for those who do not desire liberation and mystic power.</p>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#561" id="561">5.6.1</a></strong></p>
<p>rajovaca</p>
<p>na nunam bhagava atmaramanam yoga-samirita-jnanavabharjita-karma-bijanam aisvaryani punah klesadani bhavitum arhanti yadrc-chayopagatani.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>raja uvaca—King Pariksit inquired; na—not; nunam—indeed; bhagavah—O most powerful Sukadeva Gosvami; atmaramanam—of pure devotees simply engaged in devotional service; yoga-samirita—achieved by practice of yoga; jnana—by knowledge; avabharjita—burned; karma-bijanam—of those whose seeds of fruitive activities; aisvaryani—the mystic powers; punah—again; klesadani—sources of distress; bhavitum—to become; arhanti—are able; yadrcchaya—automatically; upagatani—achieved.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pariksit asked Sukadeva Gosvami: My dear Lord, for those who are completely pure in heart, knowledge is attained by the practice of bhakti-yoga, and attachment for fruitive activity is completely burned to ashes.</p>
<p>For such people, the powers of mystic yoga automatically arise.</p>
<p>They do not cause distress.</p>
<p>Why, then, did Rsabhadeva neglect them?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee is constantly engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Whatever is necessary for the discharge of devotional service is automatically attained, though it may appear to be the result of mystic yoga power.</p>
<p>Sometimes a yogi displays a little yogic power by manufacturing gold.</p>
<p>A little quantity of gold captivates foolish people, and thus the yogi gets many followers, who are willing to accept such a tiny person as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Such a yogi may also advertise himself as Bhagavan.</p>
<p>However, a devotee does not have to exhibit such magical wonders.</p>
<p>Without practicing the mystic yogic process, he achieves even greater opulence all over the world.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Lord Rsabhadeva refused to manifest mystic yogic perfections, and Maharaja Pariksit asked why He did not accept them, since, for a devotee, they are not at all disturbing.</p>
<p>A devotee is never distressed or satisfied by material opulence.</p>
<p>His concern is how to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee achieves extraordinary opulence, he utilizes the opportunity for the Lord’s service.</p>
<p>He is not disturbed by the opulence.</p>
