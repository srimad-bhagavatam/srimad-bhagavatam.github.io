<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#515" id="515">5.15</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of Bharata Maharaja and many other kings are described.</p>
<p>The son of Maharaja Bharata was named Sumati.</p>
<p>He followed the path of liberation given by Rsabhadeva.</p>
<p>Some people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>The son of Sumati was Devatajit, and his son was Devadyumna.</p>
<p>Devadyumna’s son was Paramesthi, and his son was Pratiha.</p>
<p>Pratiha was a very great devotee of Lord Visnu, and he had three sons, named Pratiharta, Prastota and Udgata.</p>
<p>Pratiharta had two sons, Aja and Bhuma.</p>
<p>The son of Bhuma was Udgitha, and the son of Udgitha was Prastava.</p>
<p>The son of Prastava was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was Prthusena, whose son was Nakta.</p>
<p>The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king.</p>
<p>Actually King Gaya was a partial incarnation of Lord Visnu, and because of his great devotion to Lord Visnu he received the title Mahapurusa.</p>
<p>King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana.</p>
<p>The son of Citraratha was the emperor Samrat, and his son was Marici, whose son was Bindu.</p>
<p>Bindu’s son was Madhu, and Madhu’s son was Viravrata.</p>
<p>Viravrata’s two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was Bhauvana.</p>
<p>The son of Bhauvana was Tvasta, and the son of Tvasta was Viraja, who glorified the whole dynasty.</p>
<p>Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter.</p>
<p>Of these, the son named Satajit became very famous.</p>

<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>bharatasyatmajah sumatir namabhihito yam u ha vava kecit pakhandina rsabha-padavim anuvartamanam canarya aveda-samamnatam devatam sva-manisaya papiyasya kalau kalpayisyanti.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak; bharatasya—of Bharata Maharaja; atma-jah—the son; sumatih nama-abhihitah—named Sumati; yam—unto whom; u ha vava—indeed; kecit—some; pakhandinah—atheists, men without Vedic knowledge; rsabha-padavim—the path of King Rsabhadeva; anuvartamanam—following; ca—and; anaryah—not belonging to the Aryans who strictly follow the Vedic principles; aveda-samamnatam—not enumerated in the Vedas; devatam—to be Lord Buddha or a similar Buddhist deity; sva-manisaya—by their own mental speculation; papiyasya—most sinful; kalau—in this age of Kali; kalpayisyanti—will imagine.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: The son of Maharaja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of Rsabhadeva, but some unscrupulous people imagined him to be Lord Buddha himself.</p>
<p>These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities.</p>
<p>Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati.</p>
<p>In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who are Aryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the arya-samaja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the parampara system.</p>
<p>Their leaders decry all bona fide acaryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>These acaryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the arya-samajas, or the Jains.</p>
<p>Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they claim to be the descendants of Rsabhadeva.</p>
<p>Those who are Vaisnavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the Vedas.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) Krsna says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: The real purpose of the Vedas is to understand Me This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>One who does not know the greatness of Lord Krsna cannot be accepted as an Aryan.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord Krsna, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of bhagavata-dharma.</p>
<p>He preached almost exclusively among atheists.</p>
<p>Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit.</p>
<p>Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God.</p>
