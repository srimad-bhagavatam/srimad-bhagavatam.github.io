<h1>The Glories of the Descendants of King Priyavrata</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>5.15</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of Bharata Maharaja and many other kings are described.</p>
<p>The son of Maharaja Bharata was named Sumati.</p>
<p>He followed the path of liberation given by Rsabhadeva.</p>
<p>Some people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>The son of Sumati was Devatajit, and his son was Devadyumna.</p>
<p>Devadyumna’s son was Paramesthi, and his son was Pratiha.</p>
<p>Pratiha was a very great devotee of Lord Visnu, and he had three sons, named Pratiharta, Prastota and Udgata.</p>
<p>Pratiharta had two sons, Aja and Bhuma.</p>
<p>The son of Bhuma was Udgitha, and the son of Udgitha was Prastava.</p>
<p>The son of Prastava was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was Prthusena, whose son was Nakta.</p>
<p>The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king.</p>
<p>Actually King Gaya was a partial incarnation of Lord Visnu, and because of his great devotion to Lord Visnu he received the title Mahapurusa.</p>
<p>King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana.</p>
<p>The son of Citraratha was the emperor Samrat, and his son was Marici, whose son was Bindu.</p>
<p>Bindu’s son was Madhu, and Madhu’s son was Viravrata.</p>
<p>Viravrata’s two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was Bhauvana.</p>
<p>The son of Bhauvana was Tvasta, and the son of Tvasta was Viraja, who glorified the whole dynasty.</p>
<p>Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter.</p>
<p>Of these, the son named Satajit became very famous.</p>
<p><strong>5.15.1</strong></p>
<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>bharatasyatmajah sumatir namabhihito yam u ha vava kecit pakhandina rsabha-padavim anuvartamanam canarya aveda-samamnatam devatam sva-manisaya papiyasya kalau kalpayisyanti.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak; bharatasya—of Bharata Maharaja; atma-jah—the son; sumatih nama-abhihitah—named Sumati; yam—unto whom; u ha vava—indeed; kecit—some; pakhandinah—atheists, men without Vedic knowledge; rsabha-padavim—the path of King Rsabhadeva; anuvartamanam—following; ca—and; anaryah—not belonging to the Aryans who strictly follow the Vedic principles; aveda-samamnatam—not enumerated in the Vedas; devatam—to be Lord Buddha or a similar Buddhist deity; sva-manisaya—by their own mental speculation; papiyasya—most sinful; kalau—in this age of Kali; kalpayisyanti—will imagine.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: The son of Maharaja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of Rsabhadeva, but some unscrupulous people imagined him to be Lord Buddha himself.</p>
<p>These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities.</p>
<p>Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati.</p>
<p>In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who are Aryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the arya-samaja, which is ignorant of the import of the Vedas in the parampara system.</p>
<p>Their leaders decry all bona fide acaryas, and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>These acaryas who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the arya-samajas, or the Jains.</p>
<p>Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they claim to be the descendants of Rsabhadeva.</p>
<p>Those who are Vaisnavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the Vedas.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) Krsna says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: The real purpose of the Vedas is to understand Me This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>One who does not know the greatness of Lord Krsna cannot be accepted as an Aryan.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord Krsna, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of bhagavata-dharma.</p>
<p>He preached almost exclusively among atheists.</p>
<p>Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit.</p>
<p>Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasmat—from Sumati; vrddha-senayam—in the womb of his wife, named Vrddhasena; devatajit-nama—named Devatajit; putrah—a son; abhavat—was born.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From Sumati, a son named Devatajit was born by the womb of his wife named Vrddhasena.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.3</strong></p>

<p>Devadyumna begot in the womb of his wife, Dhenumati, a son named Paramesthi.</p>
<p>Paramesthi begot a son named Pratiha in the womb of his wife, Suvarcala.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.4</strong></p>
<p>ya atma-vidyam akhyaya svayam samsuddho maha-purusam anusasmara.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—who (King Pratiha); atma-vidyam akhyaya—after instructing many people about self-realization; svayam—personally; samsuddhah—being very advanced and purified in self-realization; maha-purusam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu; anusasmara—perfectly understood and always remembered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pratiha personally propagated the principles of self-realization.</p>
<p>In this way, not only was he purified, but he became a great devotee of the Supreme Person, Lord Visnu, and directly realized Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word anusasmara is very significant.</p>
<p>God consciousness is not imaginary or concocted.</p>
<p>The devotee who is pure and advanced realizes God as He is.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pratiha did so, and due to his direct realization of Lord Visnu, he propagated self-realization and became a preacher.</p>
<p>A real preacher cannot be bogus; he must first of all realize Lord Visnu as He is.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.34), upadeksyanti te jnanam jnaninas tattva-darsinah: one who has seen the truth can impart knowledge The word tattva-darsi refers to one who has perfectly realized the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Such a person can become a guru and propound Vaisnava philosophy all over the world.</p>
<p>The paragon of bona fide preachers and guru is King Pratiha.</p>

<p>These three sons were very expert in performing Vedic rituals.</p>
<p>Pratiharta begot two sons, named Aja and Bhuma, in the womb of his wife, named Stuti.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.6</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the womb of his wife, Rsikulya, King Bhuma begot a son named Udgitha.</p>
<p>From Udgitha’s wife, Devakulya, a son named Prastava was born, and Prastava begot a son named Vibhu through his wife, Niyutsa.</p>
<p>In the womb of his wife, Rati, Vibhu begot a son named Prthusena.</p>
<p>Prthusena begot a son named Nakta in the womb of his wife, named Akuti.</p>
<p>Nakta’s wife was Druti, and from her womb the great King Gaya was born.</p>
<p>Gaya was very famous and pious; he was the best of saintly kings.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu and His expansions, who are meant to protect the universe, are always situated in the transcendental mode of goodness, known as visuddha-sattva.</p>
<p>Being the direct expansion of Lord Visnu, King Gaya was also situated in the visuddha-sattva.</p>
<p>Because of this, Maharaja Gaya was fully equipped with transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore he was called Mahapurusa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From this verse it appears that the incarnations of God are various.</p>
<p>Some are part and parcel of the direct expansions, and some are direct expansions of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>A direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called amsa or svamsa, whereas an incarnation from amsa is called kala.</p>
<p>Among the kalas there are the vibhinnamsa-jivas, or living entities.</p>
<p>These are counted among the jiva-tattvas.</p>
<p>Those who come directly from Lord Visnu are called visnu-tattva and are sometimes designated as Mahapurusa.</p>
<p>Another name for Krsna is Mahapurusa, and a devotee is sometimes called maha-paurusika.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Gaya gave full protection and security to the citizens so that their personal property would not be disturbed by undesirable elements.</p>
<p>He also saw that there was sufficient food to feed all the citizens (This is called posana.) He would sometimes distribute gifts to the citizens to satisfy them (This is called prinana.) He would sometimes call meetings and satisfy the citizens with sweet words (This is called upalalana.) He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens (This is called anusasana.) Such were the characteristics of King Gaya’s royal order.</p>
<p>Besides all this, King Gaya was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life.</p>
<p>He performed sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He was called Mahapurusa because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>As a devotee, he was always ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the bhakti-yoga process.</p>
<p>Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily conception.</p>
<p>He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant.</p>
<p>He did not experience material lamentation.</p>
<p>Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he anxious to rule the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As Lord Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita, when He descends on earth, He has two types of business—to give protection to the faithful and annihilate the demons (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)).</p>
<p>Since the king is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is sometimes called nara-deva, that is, the Lord as a human being.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic injunctions, he is worshiped as God on the material platform.</p>
<p>As a representative of the Supreme Lord, the king had the duty to protect the citizens in a perfect way so that they would not be anxious for food and protection and so that they would be jubilant.</p>
<p>The king would supply everything for their benefit, and because of this he would levy taxes.</p>
<p>If the king or government otherwise levies taxes on the citizens, he becomes responsible for the sinful activities of the citizens.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, monarchy is abolished because the kings themselves are subjected to the influence of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>It is understood from the Ramayana that when Bibhisana became friends with Lord Ramacandra, he promised that if by chance or will he broke the laws of friendship with Lord Ramacandra, he would become a brahmana or a king in Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>In this age, as Bibhisana indicated, both brahmanas and kings are in a wretched condition.</p>
<p>Actually there are no kings or brahmanas in this age, and due to their absence the whole world is in a chaotic condition and is always in distress.</p>
<p>Compared to present standards, Maharaja Gaya was a true representative of Lord Visnu; therefore he was known as Mahapurusa.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.8</strong></p>
<p>tasyemam gatham pandaveya puravida upagayanti.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasya—of King Gaya; imam—these; gatham—poetic verses of glorification; pandaveya—O Maharaja Pariksit; pura-vidah—those learned in the historical events of the puranas; upagayanti—sing.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King Pariksit, those who are learned scholars in the histories of the Puranas eulogize and glorify King Gaya with the following verses.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The historical references to exalted kings serve as a good example for present rulers.</p>
<p>Those who are ruling the world at the present moment should take lessons from King Gaya, King Yudhisthira and King Prthu and rule the citizens so that they will be happy presently the governments are levying taxes without improving the citizens in any cultural, religious, social or political way.</p>
<p>According to the Vedas, this is not recommended.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.9</strong></p>
<p>gayam nrpah kah pratiyati karmabhir</p>
<p>yajvabhimani bahuvid dharma-gopta</p>
<p>samagata-srih sadasas-patih satam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great King Gaya used to perform all kinds of Vedic rituals.</p>
<p>He was highly intelligent and expert in studying all the Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>He maintained the religious principles and possessed all kinds of opulence.</p>
<p>He was a leader among gentlemen and a servant of the devotees.</p>
<p>He was a totally qualified plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.10</strong></p>
<p>yam abhyasincan paraya muda satih</p>
<p>satyasiso daksa-kanyah saridbhih</p>
<p>yasya prajanam duduhe dharasiso</p>
<p>nirasiso guna-vatsa-snutodhah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yam—whom; abhyasincan—bathed; paraya—with great; muda—satisfaction; satih—all chaste and devoted to their husbands; satya—true; asisah—whose blessings; daksa-kanyah—the daughters of King Daksa; saridbhih—with sanctified water; yasya—whose; prajanam—of the citizens; duduhe—fulfilled; dhara—the planet earth; asisah—of all desires; nirasisah—although personally having no desire; guna-vatsa-snuta-udhah—earth becoming like a cow whose udders flowed upon seeing Gaya’s qualities in ruling over the citizens.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All the chaste and honest daughters of Maharaja Daksa, such as Sraddha, Maitri and Daya, whose blessings were always effective, bathed Maharaja Gaya with sanctified water.</p>
<p>Indeed, they were very satisfied with Maharaja Gaya.</p>
<p>The planet earth personified came as a cow, and, as though she saw her calf, she delivered milk profusely when she saw all the good qualities of Maharaja Gaya.</p>
<p>In other words, Maharaja Gaya was able to derive all benefits from the earth and thus satisfy the desires of his citizens.</p>
<p>However, he personally had no desire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The earth over which Maharaja Gaya ruled is compared to a cow.</p>
<p>The good qualities whereby he maintained and ruled the citizens are compared to the calf.</p>
<p>A cow delivers milk in the presence of her calf; similarly the cow, or earth, fulfilled the desires of Maharaja Gaya, who was able to utilize all the resources of the earth to benefit his citizens.</p>
<p>This was possible because he was bathed in sanctified water by the honest daughters of Daksa.</p>
<p>Unless a king or ruler is blessed by authorities, he cannot rule the citizens very satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Through the good qualities of the ruler, the citizens become very happy and well qualified.</p>



<p><strong>5.15.11</strong></p>
<p>chandamsy akamasya ca yasya kaman</p>
<p>duduhur ajahrur atho balim nrpah</p>
<p>pratyancita yudhi dharmena vipra</p>
<p>yadasisam sastham amsam paretya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>chandamsi—all the different parts of the Vedas; akamasya—of one who has no desire for personal sense gratification; ca—also; yasya—whose; kaman—all desirables; duduhuh—yielded; ajahruh—offered; atho—thus; balim—presentation; nrpah—all the kings; pratyancitah—being satisfied by his fighting in opposition; yudhi—in the war; dharmena—by religious principles; viprah—all the brahmanas; yada—when; asisam—of blessings; sastham amsam—one sixth; paretya—in the next life.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals.</p>
<p>All the kings with whom Maharaja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles.</p>
<p>They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the brahmanas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya’s munificent charities.</p>
<p>Consequently the brahmanas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya’s benefit in the next life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As a ksatriya or emperor, Maharaja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles.</p>
<p>Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him.</p>
<p>Similarly, the brahmanas who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life.</p>
<p>Thus the brahmanas and ksatriyas were all satisfied with Maharaja Gaya because of his proper administration.</p>
<p>In other words.</p>
<p>Maharaja Gaya satisfied the ksatriya kings by his fighting and satisfied the brahmanas by his charities.</p>
<p>The vaisyas were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Maharaja Gaya’s constant sacrifices, the sudras were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity.</p>
<p>In this way Maharaja Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied.</p>
<p>When brahmanas and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service.</p>
<p>Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.34), tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya: one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.</p>

<p>Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu (the yajna-purusa) also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Gaya was so perfect that he satisfied all the demigods, who were headed by the heavenly King Indra.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu Himself also personally came to the sacrificial arena to accept the offerings.</p>
<p>Although Maharaja Gaya did not want them, he received all the blessings of the demigods and the Supreme Lord Himself.</p>
