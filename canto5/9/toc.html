<h1><a class="header" href="#the-supreme-character-of-jada-bharata" id="the-supreme-character-of-jada-bharata">The Supreme Character of Jada Bharata</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#59" id="59">5.9</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter Bharata Maharaja’s attainment of the body of a brahmana is described.</p>
<p>In this body he remained like one dull, deaf and dumb, so much so that when he was brought before the goddess Kali to be killed as a sacrifice, he never protested but remained silent.</p>
<p>After having given up the body of a deer, he took birth in the womb of the youngest wife of a brahmana.</p>
<p>In this life he could also remember the activities of his past life, and in order to avoid the influence of society, he remained like a deaf and dumb person.</p>
<p>He was very careful not to fall down again.</p>
<p>He did not mix with anyone who was not a devotee.</p>
<p>This process should be adopted by every devotee.</p>
<p>As advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: asat-sanga-tyaga—ei vaisnava-acara.</p>
<p>One should strictly avoid the company of nondevotees, even though they may be family members.</p>
<p>When Bharata Maharaja was in the body of a brahmana, the people in the neighborhood thought of him as a crazy, dull fellow, but within he was always chanting and remembering Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Although his father wanted to give him an education and purify him as a brahmana by offering him the sacred thread, he remained in such a way that his father and mother could understand that he was crazy and not interested in the reformatory method.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he remained fully Krsna conscious, even without undergoing such official ceremonies.</p>
<p>Due to his silence, some people who were no better than animals began to tease him in many ways, but he tolerated this.</p>
<p>After the death of his father and mother, his stepmother and stepbrothers began to treat him very poorly.</p>
<p>They would give him the most condemned food, but still he did not mind; he remained completely absorbed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>He was ordered by his stepbrothers and mother to guard a paddy field one night, and at that time the leader of a dacoit party took him away and tried to kill him by offering him as a sacrifice before Bhadra Kali.</p>
<p>When the dacoits brought Bharata Maharaja before the goddess Kali and raised a chopper to kill him, the goddess Kali became immediately alarmed due to the mistreatment of a devotee.</p>
<p>She came out of the deity and, taking the chopper in her own hands, killed all the dacoits there.</p>
<p>Thus a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can remain silent despite the mistreatment of nondevotees.</p>
<p>Rogues and dacoits who misbehave toward a devotee are punished at last by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
