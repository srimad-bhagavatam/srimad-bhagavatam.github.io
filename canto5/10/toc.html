<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#510" id="510">5.10</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter Bharata Maharaja, now Jada Bharata, was successfully accepted by King Rahugana, ruler of the states known as Sindhu and Sauvira.</p>
<p>The King forced Jada Bharata to carry his palanquin and chastised him because he did not carry it properly.</p>
<p>A carrier of King Rahugana’s palanquin was needed, and to fulfill this need the chief carriers found Jada Bharata as the most likely person to do the work.</p>
<p>He was therefore forced to carry the palanquin.</p>
<p>Jada Bharata, however, did not protest this proud order, but humbly accepted the job and carried the palanquin.</p>
<p>While carrying it, however, he was very careful to see that he did not step on an ant, and whenever he saw one, he would stop until the ant had passed.</p>
<p>Because of this, he could not keep pace with the other carriers.</p>
<p>The King within the palanquin became very disturbed and chastised Jada Bharata with filthy language, but Jada Bharata, being completely freed from the bodily conception, did not protest; he proceeded carrying the palanquin.</p>
<p>When he continued as before, the King threatened him with punishment, and being threatened by the King, Jada Bharata began to talk.</p>
<p>He protested against the filthy language used by the King when the King chastised him, and the King, hearing the instructions of Jada Bharata, was awakened to his real knowledge.</p>
<p>When he came to his consciousness, he understood that he had offended a great, learned and saintly person.</p>
<p>At that time he very humbly and respectfully prayed to Jada Bharata.</p>
<p>He now wanted to understand the deep meaning of the philosophical words used by Jada Bharata, and with great sincerity, he begged his pardon.</p>
<p>He admitted that if one offends the lotus feet of a pure devotee, he is certainly punished by the trident of Lord Siva.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after this, King Rahugana, ruler of the states known as Sindhu and Sauvira, was going to Kapilasrama.</p>
<p>When the King’s chief palanquin carriers reached the banks of the River Iksumati, they needed another carrier.</p>
<p>Therefore they began searching for someone, and by chance they came upon Jada Bharata.</p>
<p>They considered the fact that Jada Bharata was very young and strong and had firm limbs.</p>
<p>Like cows and asses, he was quite fit to carry loads.</p>
<p>Thinking in this way, although the great soul Jada Bharata was unfit for such work, they nonetheless unhesitatingly forced him to carry the palanquin.</p>
