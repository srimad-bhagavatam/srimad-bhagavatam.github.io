<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When King Pariksit asked Sukadeva Gosvami about the direct meaning of the material forest, Sukadeva Gosvami replied as follows: My dear King, a man belonging to the mercantile community (vanik) is always interested in earning money.</p>
<p>Sometimes he enters the forest to acquire some cheap commodities like wood and earth and sell them in the city at good prices.</p>
<p>Similarly, the conditioned soul, being greedy, enters this material world for some material profit.</p>
<p>Gradually he enters the deepest part of the forest, not really knowing how to get out.</p>
<p>Having entered the material world, the pure soul becomes conditioned by the material atmosphere, which is created by the external energy under the control of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Thus the living entity comes under the control of the external energy, daivi maya.</p>
<p>Living independently and bewildered in the forest, he does not attain the association of devotees who are always engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Once in the bodily conception, he gets different types of bodies one after the other under the influence of material energy and impelled by the modes of material nature (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna).</p>
<p>In this way the conditioned soul goes sometimes to the heavenly planets, sometimes to the earthly planets and sometimes to the lower planets and lower species.</p>
<p>Thus he suffers continuously due to different types of bodies.</p>
<p>These sufferings and pains are sometimes mixed.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are very severe, and sometimes they are not.</p>
<p>These bodily conditions are acquired due to the conditioned soul’s mental speculation.</p>
<p>He uses his mind and five senses to acquire knowledge, and these bring about the different bodies and different conditions.</p>
<p>Using the senses under the control of the external energy, maya, the living entity suffers the miserable conditions of material existence.</p>
<p>He is actually searching for relief, but he is generally baffled, although sometimes he is relieved after great difficulty.</p>
<p>Struggling for existence in this way, he cannot get the shelter of pure devotees, who are like bumblebees engaged in loving service at the lotus feet of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The most important information in this verse is hari-guru-carana-aravinda-madhukara-anupadavim.</p>
<p>In this material world the conditioned souls are baffled by their activities, and sometimes they are relieved after great difficulty.</p>
<p>On the whole the conditioned soul is never happy.</p>
<p>He simply struggles for existence.</p>
<p>Actually his only business is to accept the spiritual master, the guru, and through him he must accept the lotus feet or the Lord.</p>
<p>This is explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija people struggling for existence in the forests or cities of the material world are not actually enjoying life.</p>
<p>They are simply suffering different pains and pleasures, generally pains that are always inauspicious.</p>
<p>They try to gain release from these pains, but they cannot due to ignorance.</p>
<p>For them it is stated in the Vedas: tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet (MU1.2.12).</p>
<p>When the living entity is lost in the forest of the material world, in the struggle for existence, his first business is to find a bona fide guru who is always engaged at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu.</p>
<p>After all, if he is at all eager to be relieved of the struggle for existence, he must find a bona fide guru and take instructions at his lotus feet.</p>
<p>In this way he can get out of the struggle.</p>
<p>Since the material world is compared herein to a forest, it may be argued that in Kali-yuga modern civilization is mainly situated in the cities.</p>
<p>A great city, however, is like a great forest.</p>
<p>Actually city life is more dangerous than life in the forest.</p>
<p>If one enters an unknown city without friend or shelter, living in that city is more difficult than living in a forest.</p>
<p>There are many big cities all over the surface of the globe, and wherever one looks he sees the struggle for existence going on twenty-four hours a day people rush about in cars going seventy and eighty miles an hour, constantly coming and going, and this sets the scene of the great struggle for existence.</p>
<p>One has to rise early in the morning and travel in that car at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>There is always the danger of an accident, and one has to take great care.</p>
<p>In his automobile, the living entity is full of anxieties, and his struggle is not at all auspicious.</p>
<p>Apart from human beings, other species like cats and dogs are also struggling very hard day and night for existence.</p>
<p>Thus the struggle for existence continues, and the conditioned soul changes from one position to another.</p>
<p>For a while, he is a child, but he has to become a boy.</p>
<p>From a boy, he has to change into a youth, and from youth to manhood and old age.</p>
<p>Finally, when the body is no longer workable, he has to accept a new body in a different species.</p>
<p>Giving up the body is called death, and accepting another body is called birth.</p>
<p>The human form is an opportunity to take shelter of the bona fide spiritual master and, through him, the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This Krsna consciousness movement has been started to give an opportunity to all the members of human society, who are misled by foolish leaders.</p>
<p>No one can get out of this struggle for existence, which is full of miseries, without accepting a pure devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>The material attempt changes from one position to another, and no one actually gains relief from the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>The only resort is the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, and, through him, the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
