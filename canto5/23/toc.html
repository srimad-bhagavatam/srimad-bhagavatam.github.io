<h1><a class="header" href="#the-sisumara-planetary-systems" id="the-sisumara-planetary-systems">The Sisumara Planetary Systems</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#523" id="523">5.23</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how all the planetary systems take shelter of the polestar, Dhruvaloka.</p>
<p>It also describes the totality of these planetary systems to be Sisumara, another expansion of the external body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Dhruvaloka, the abode of Lord Visnu within this universe, is situated 1,300,000 yojanas from the seven stars.</p>
<p>In the planetary system of Dhruvaloka are the planets of the fire-god, Indra, Prajapati, Kasyapa and Dharma, all of whom are very respectful to the great devotee Dhruva, who lives on the polestar.</p>
<p>Like bulls yoked to a central pivot, all the planetary systems revolve around Dhruvaloka, impelled by eternal time.</p>
<p>Those who worship the virat-purusa, the universal form of the Lord, conceive of this entire rotating system of planets as an animal known as sisumara.</p>
<p>This imaginary sisumara is another form of the Lord.</p>
<p>The head of the sisumara form is downward, and its body appears like that of a coiled snake.</p>
<p>On the end of its tail is Dhruvaloka, on the body of the tail are Prajapati, Agni, Indra and Dharma, and on the root of the tail are Dhata and Vidhata.</p>
<p>On its waist are the seven great sages.</p>
<p>The entire body of the sisumara faces toward its right and appears like a coil of stars.</p>
<p>On the right side of this coil are the fourteen prominent stars from Abhijit to Punarvasu, and on the left side are the fourteen prominent stars from Pusya to Uttarasadha.</p>
<p>The stars known as Punarvasu and Pusya are on the right and left hips of the sisumara, and the stars known as Ardra and Aslesa are on the right and left feet of the sisumara.</p>
<p>Other stars are also fixed on different sides of the Sisumara planetary system according to the calculations of Vedic astronomers.</p>
<p>To concentrate their minds, yogis worship the Sisumara planetary system, which is technically known as the kundalini-cakra.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, 1,300,000 yojanas (10,400,000 miles) above the planets of the seven sages is the place that learned scholars describe as the abode of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>There the son of Maharaja Uttanapada, the great devotee Maharaja Dhruva, still resides as the life source of all the living entities who live until the end of the creation.</p>
<p>Agni, Indra, Prajapati, Kasyapa and Dharma all assemble there to offer him honor and respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>They circumambulate him with their right sides toward him.</p>
<p>I have already described the glorious activities of Maharaja Dhruva (in the Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam).</p>
