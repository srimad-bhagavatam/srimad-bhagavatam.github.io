<h1>The Subterranean Heavenly Planets</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>5.24</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the plane Rahu, which is 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles) below the sun, and it also describes Atala and the other lower planeary systems.</p>
<p>Rahu is situated below the sun and moon.</p>
<p>It is between these two planes and the earth.</p>
<p>When Rahu conceals the sun and moon, eclipses occur, either total or partial, depending on whether Rahu moves in a straight or curving way.</p>
<p>Below Rahu by another 1,000,000 yojanas are the planes of the Siddhas, Caranas and Vidyadharas, and below these are planes such as Yaksaloka and Raksaloka.</p>
<p>Below these planes is the earth, and 70,000 yojanas below the earth are the lower planeary systems—Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala.</p>
<p>Demons and Raksasas live in these lower planeary systems with their wives and children, always engaged in sense gratification and not fearing their next births.</p>
<p>The sunshine does not reach these planes, but they are illuminated by jewels fixed upon the hoods of snakes.</p>
<p>Because of these shining gems there is practically no darkness.</p>
<p>Those living in these planes do not become old or diseased, and they are not afraid of death from any cause but the time factor, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the plane Atala, the yawning of a demon has produced three kinds of women, called svairini (independent), kamini (lusty) and pumscali (very easily subdued by men).</p>
<p>Below Atala is the plane Vitala, wherein Lord Siva and his wife Gauri reside.</p>
<p>Because of their presence, a kind of gold is produced called hataka.</p>
<p>Below Vitala is the plane Sutala, the abode of Bali Maharaja, the most fortunate king.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vamanadeva, because of his intense devotional service.</p>
<p>The Lord went to the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaja and begged him for three paces of land, and on this plea the Lord took from him all his possessions.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja agreed to all this, the Lord was very pleased, and therefore the Lord serves as his doorkeeper.</p>
<p>The description of Bali Maharaja appears in the Eighth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead offers a devotee material happiness, this is not His real favor.</p>
<p>The demigods, who are very puffed up by their material opulence, pray to the Lord only for material happiness, not knowing anything better.</p>
<p>Devotees like Prahlada Maharaja, however, do not want material happiness.</p>
<p>Not to speak of material happiness, they do not want even liberation from material bondage, although one can achieve this liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, even with improper pronunciation.</p>
<p>Below Sutala is the plane Talatala, the abode of the demon Maya.</p>
<p>This demon is always materially happy because he is favored by Lord Siva, but he cannot achieve spiritual happiness at any time.</p>
<p>Below Talatala is the plane Mahatala, where there are many snakes with hundreds and thousands of hoods.</p>
<p>Below Mahatala is Rasatala, and below that is Patala, where the serpent Vasuki lives with his associates.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; adhastat—below; savituh—the sun globe; yojana—a measurement equal to eight miles; ayute—ten thousand; svarbhanuh—the plane known as Rahu; naksatra-vat—like one of the stars; carati—is rotating; iti—thus; eke—some who are learned in the Puranas; yah—which; asau—that; amaratvam—a lifetime like those of the demigods; grahatvam—a position as one of the chief planes; ca—and; alabhata—obtained; bhagavat-anukampaya—by the compassion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; svayam—personally; asura-apasadah—the lowest of the asuras; saimhikeyah—being the son of Simhika; hi—indeed; a-tat-arhah—not qualified for that position; tasya—his; tata—O my dear King; janma—birth; karmani—activities; ca—also; uparistat—later; vaksyamah—I shall explain.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, some historians, the speakers of the Puranas, say that 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles) below the sun is the plane known as Rahu, which moves like one of the stars.</p>
<p>The presiding deity of that plane, who is the son of Simhika, is the most abominable of all asuras, but although he is completely unfit to assume the position of a demigod or planeary deity, he has achieved that position by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Later I shall speak further about him.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.2</strong></p>
<p>yad adas taraner mandalam pratapatas tad vistarato yojanayutam acaksate dvadasa-sahasram somasya trayodasa-sahasram rahor yah parvani tad-vyavadhana-krd vairanubandhah surya-candramasav abhidhavati.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat—which; adah—that; taraneh—of the sun; mandalam—globe; pratapatah—which is always distributing heat; tat—that; vistaratah—in terms of width; yojana—a distance of eight miles; ayutam—ten thousand; acaksate—they estimate; dvadasa-sahasram—20,000 yojanas (160,000 miles); somasya—of the moon; trayodasa—thirty; sahasram—one thousand; rahoh—of the plane Rahu; yah—which; parvani—on occasion; tat-vyavadhana-krt—who created an obstruction to the sun and moon at the time of the distribution of nectar; vaira-anubandhah—whose intentions are inimical; surya—the sun; candramasau—and the moon; abhidhavati—runs after them on the full-moon night and the dark-moon day.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sun globe, which is a source of heat, extends for 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles).</p>
<p>The moon extends for 20,000 yojanas (160,000 miles), and Rahu extends for 30,000 yojanas (240,000 miles).</p>
<p>Formerly, when nectar was being distributed, Rahu tried to create dissension between the sun and moon by interposing himself between them.</p>
<p>Rahu is inimical toward both the sun and the moon, and therefore he always tries to cover the sunshine and moonshine on the dark-moon day and full-moon night.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated herein, the sun extends for 10,000 yojanas, and the moon extends for twice that, or 20,000 yojanas.</p>
<p>The word dvadasa should be understood to mean twice as much as ten, or twenty.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Vijayadhvaja, the extent of Rahu should be twice that of the moon, or text of the Bhagavatam, Vijayadhvaja cites the following quotation concerning Rahu; rahu-soma-ravinam tu mandala dvi-gunoktitam.</p>
<p>This means that Rahu is twice as large as the moon, which is twice as large as the sun.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of the commentator Vijayadhvaja.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.3</strong></p>
<p>tan nisamyobhayatrapi bhagavata raksanaya prayuktam sudarsanam nama bhagavatam dayitam astram tat tejasa durvisaham muhuh parivartamanam abhyavasthito muhurtam udvijamanas cakita-hrdaya arad eva nivartate tad uparagam iti vadanti lokah.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—that situation; nisamya—hearing; ubhayatra—around both the sun and moon; api—indeed; bhagavata—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; raksanaya—for their protection; prayuktam—engaged; sudarsanam—the wheel of Krsna; nama—named; bhagavatam—the most confidential devotee; dayitam—the most favorite; astram—weapon; tat—that; tejasa—by its effulgence; durvisaham—unbearable heat; muhuh—repeatedly; parivartamanam—moving around the sun and moon; abhyavasthitah—situated; muhurtam—for a muhurta (forty-eight minutes); udvijamanah—whose mind was full of anxieties; cakita—frightened; hrdayah—the core of whose heart; arat—to a distant place; eva—certainly; nivartate—flees; tat—that situation; uparagam—an eclipse; iti—thus; vadanti—they say; lokah—the people.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After hearing from the sun and moon demigods about Rahu’s attack, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, engages His disc, known as the Sudarsana cakra, to protect them.</p>
<p>The Sudarsana cakra is the Lord’s most beloved devotee and is favored by the Lord.</p>
<p>The intense heat of its effulgence, meant for killing non-Vaisnavas, is unbearable to Rahu, and he therefore flees in fear of it.</p>
<p>During the time Rahu disturbs the sun or moon, there occurs what people commonly know as an eclipse.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is always the protector of His devotees, who are also known as demigods.</p>
<p>The controlling demigods are most obedient to Lord Visnu, although they also want material sense enjoyment, and that is why they are called demigods, or almost godly.</p>
<p>Although Rahu attempts to attack both the sun and the moon, they are protected by Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Being very afraid of Lord Visnu’s cakra, Rahu cannot stay in front of the sun or moon for more than a muhurta (forty-eight minutes).</p>
<p>The phenomenon that occurs when Rahu blocks the light of the sun or moon is called an eclipse.</p>
<p>The attempt of the scientists of this earth to go to the moon is as demoniac as Rahu’s attack.</p>
<p>Of course their attempts will be failures because no one can enter the moon or sun so easily.</p>
<p>Like the attack of Rahu, such attempts will certainly be failures.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.4</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Below Rahu by 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles) are the planes known as Siddhaloka, Caranaloka and Vidyadhara-loka.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that the residents of Siddhaloka, being naturally endowed with the powers of yogis, can go from one plane to another by their natural mystic powers without using airplanes or similar machines.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.5</strong></p>

<p>Antariksa extends as far as the wind blows and the clouds float in the sky.</p>
<p>Above this there is no more air.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.6</strong></p>

<p><strong>5.24.7</strong></p>
<p>upavarnitam bhumer yatha-sannivesavasthanam avaner apy adhastat sapta bhu-vivara ekaikaso yojanayutantarenayama-vistarenopaklpta atalam vitalam sutalam talatalam mahatalam rasatalam patalam iti.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, beneath this earth are seven other planes, known as Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala.</p>
<p>I have already explained the situation of the planeary systems of earth.</p>
<p>The width and length of the seven lower planeary systems are calculated to be exactly the same as those of earth.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.8</strong></p>
<p>etesu hi bila-svargesu svargad apy adhika-kama-bhogaisvaryananda-bhuti-vibhutibhih susamrddha-bhavanodyanakrida-viharesu daitya-danava-kadraveya nitya-pramuditanurakta-kalatrapatya-bandhu-suhrd-anucara grha-pataya isvarad apy apratihata-kama maya-vinoda nivasanti.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>etesu—in these; hi—certainly; bila-svargesu—known as the heavenly subterranean worlds; svargat—than the heavenly planes; api—even; adhika—a greater quantity; kama-bhoga—enjoyment of sense gratification; aisvarya-ananda—bliss due to opulence; bhuti—influence; vibhutibhih—by those things and wealth; su-samrddha—improved; bhavana—houses; udyana—gardens; akrida-viharesu—in places for different types of sense gratification; daitya—the demons; danava—ghosts; kadraveyah—snakes; nitya—who are always; pramudita—overjoyed; anurakta—because of attachment; kalatra—to wife; apatya—children; bandhu—family relations; suhrt—friends; anucarah—followers; grha-patayah—the heads of the households; isvarat—than those more capable, like the demigods; api—even; apratihata-kamah—whose fulfillment of lusty desires is unimpeded; maya—illusory; vinodah—who feel happiness; nivasanti—live.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In these seven planeary systems, which are also known as the subterranean heavens (bila-svarga), there are very beautiful houses, gardens and places of sense enjoyment, which are even more opulent than those in the higher planes because the demons have a very high standard of sensual pleasure, wealth and influence.</p>
<p>Most of the residents of these planes, who are known as Daityas, Danavas and Nagas, live as householders.</p>
<p>Their wives, children, friends and society are all fully engaged in illusory, material happiness.</p>
<p>The sense enjoyment of the demigods is sometimes disturbed, but the residents of these planes enjoy life without disturbances.</p>
<p>Thus they are understood to be very attached to illusory happiness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the statements of Prahlada Maharaja, material enjoyment is maya-sukha, illusory enjoyment.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is full of anxieties for the deliverance of all living entities from such false enjoyment.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja says, maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan: (SB 7.9.43) these fools (vimudhas) are engaged in material happiness, which is surely temporary.</p>
<p>Whether in the heavenly planes, the lower planes or the earthly planes, people are engrossed in temporary, material happiness, forgetting that in due course of time they have to change their bodies according to the material laws and suffer the repetition of birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>Not caring what will happen in the next birth, gross materialists are simply busy enjoying during the present short span of life.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is always anxious to give all such bewildered materialists the real happiness of spiritual bliss.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.9</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, in the imitation heavens known as bila-svarga there is a great demon named Maya Danava, who is an expert artist and architect.</p>
<p>He has constructed many brilliantly decorated cities.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful houses, walls, gates, assembly houses, temples, yards and temple compounds, as well as many hotels serving as residential quarters for foreigners.</p>
<p>The houses for the leaders of these planes are constructed with the most valuable jewels, and they are always crowded with living entities known as Nagas and Asuras, as well as many pigeons, parrots and similar birds.</p>
<p>All in all, these imitation heavenly cities are most beautifully situated and attractively decorated.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The parks and gardens in the artificial heavens surpass in beauty those of the upper heavenly planes.</p>
<p>The trees in those gardens, embraced by creepers, bend with a heavy burden of twigs with fruits and flowers, and therefore they appear extraordinarily beautiful.</p>
<p>That beauty could attract anyone and make his mind fully blossom in the pleasure of sense gratification.</p>
<p>There are many lakes and reservoirs with clear, transparent water, agitated by jumping fish and decorated with many flowers such as lilies, kuvalayas, kahlaras and blue and red lotuses.</p>
<p>Pairs of cakravakas and many other water birds nest in the lakes and always enjoy in a happy mood, making sweet, pleasing vibrations that are very satisfying and conducive to enjoyment of the senses.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.11</strong></p>

<p>yatra—where; ha vava—certainly; na—not; bhayam—fearfulness; ahah-ratra-adibhih—because of days and nights; kala-vibhagaih—the divisions of time; upalaksyate—is experienced.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Since there is no sunshine in those subterranean planes, time is not divided into days and nights, and consequently fear produced by time does not exist.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.12</strong></p>

<p><strong>5.24.13</strong></p>

<p>na—not; va—either; etesu—in these planes; vasatam—of those residing; divya—wonderful; ausadhi—of herbs; rasa—the juices; rasayana—and elixirs; anna—by eating; pana—drinking; snana-adibhih—by bathing in and so on; adhayah—mental troubles; vyadhayah—diseases; vali—wrinkles; palita—grey hair; jara—old age; adayah—and so on; ca—and; deha-vaivarnya—the fading of bodily luster; daurgandhya—bad odor; sveda—perspiration; klama—fatigue; glanih—lack of energy; iti—thus; vayah avasthah—miserable conditions due to increasing age; ca—and; bhavanti—are.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Since the residents of these planes drink and bathe in juices and elixirs made from wonderful herbs, they are freed from all anxieties and physical diseases.</p>
<p>They have no experience of grey hair, wrinkles or invalidity, their bodily lusters do not fade, their perspiration does not cause a bad smell, and they are not troubled by fatigue or by lack of energy or enthusiasm due to old age.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.14</strong></p>
<p>na hi tesam kalyananam prabhavati kutascana mrtyur vina bhagavat-tejasas cakrapadesat.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>They live very auspiciously and do not fear death from anything but death’s established time, which is the effulgence of the Sudarsana cakra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the defect of material existence.</p>
<p>Everything in the subterranean heavens is very nicely arranged.</p>
<p>There are well situated residential quarters, there is a pleasing atmosphere, and there are no bodily inconveniences or mental anxieties, but nevertheless those who live there have to take another birth according to karma.</p>
<p>Persons whose minds are dull cannot understand this defect of a materialistic civilization aiming at material comforts.</p>
<p>One may make his living conditions very pleasing for the senses, but despite all favorable conditions, one must in due course of time meet death.</p>
<p>The members of a demoniac civilization endeavor to make their living conditions very comfortable, but they cannot check death.</p>
<p>The influence of the Sudarsana cakra will not allow their so-called material happiness to endure.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.15</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the Sudarsana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the demons all have miscarriages due to fear of its effulgence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, now I shall describe to you the lower planeary systems, one by one, beginning from Atala.</p>
<p>In Atala there is a demon, the son of Maya Danava named Bala, who created ninety-six kinds of mystic power.</p>
<p>Some so-called yogis and svamis take advantage of this mystic power to cheat people even today.</p>
<p>Simply by yawning, the demon Bala created three kinds of women, known as svairini, kamini and pumscali.</p>
<p>The svairinis like to marry men from their own group, the kaminis marry men from any group, and the pumscalis change husbands one after another.</p>
<p>If a man enters the plane of Atala, these women immediately capture him and induce him to drink an intoxicating beverage made with a drug known as hataka (cannabis indica).</p>
<p>This intoxicant endows the man with great sexual prowess, of which the women take advantage for enjoyment.</p>
<p>A woman will enchant him with attractive glances, intimate words, smiles of love and then embraces.</p>
<p>In this way she induces him to enjoy sex with her to her full satisfaction.</p>
<p>Because of his increased sexual power, the man thinks himself stronger than ten thousand elephants and considers himself most perfect.</p>
<p>Indeed, illusioned and intoxicated by false pride, he thinks himself God, ignoring impending death.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatah—the plane Atala; adhastat—beneath; vitale—on the plane; harah—Lord Siva; bhagavan—the most powerful personality; hatakesvarah—the master of gold; sva-parsada—by his own associates; bhuta-gana—who are ghostly living beings; avrtah—surrounded; prajapati-sarga—of the creation of Lord Brahma; upabrmhanaya—to increase the population; bhavah—Lord Siva; bhavanya saha—with his wife, Bhavani; mithuni-bhutah—being united in sex; aste—remains; yatah—from that planet (Vitala); pravrtta—being emanated; sarit-pravara—the great river; hataki—Hataki; nama—named; bhavayoh viryena—due to the semina and ovum of Lord Siva and Bhavani; yatra—where; citra-bhanuh—the fire-god; matarisvana—by the wind; samidhyamanah—being brightly inflamed; ojasa—with great strength; pibati—drinks; tat—that; nisthyutam—spit out with a hissing sound; hataka-akhyam—named Hataka; suvarnam—gold; bhusanena—by different types of ornaments; asura-indra—of the great asuras; avarodhesu—in the homes; purusah—the males; saha—with; purusibhih—their wives and women; dharayanti—wear.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The next plane below Atala is Vitala, wherein Lord Siva, who is known as the master of gold mines, lives with his personal associates, the ghosts and similar living entities.</p>
<p>Lord Siva, as the progenitor, engages in sex with Bhavani, the progenitress, to produce living entities, and from the mixture of their vital fluid the river named Hataki is generated.</p>
<p>When fire, being made to blaze by the wind, drinks of this river and then sizzles and spits it out, it produces gold called Hataka.</p>
<p>The demons who live on that plane with their wives decorate themselves with various ornaments made from that gold, and thus they live there very happily.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that when Bhava and Bhavani, Lord Siva and his wife, unite sexually, the emulsification of their secretions creates a chemical which when heated by fire can produce gold.</p>
<p>It is said that the alchemists of the medieval age tried to prepare gold from base metal, and Srila Sanatana Gosvami also states that when bell metal is treated with mercury, it can produce gold.</p>
<p>Srila Sanatana Gosvami mentions this in regard to the initiation of low-class men to turn them into brahmanas.</p>
<p>Sanatana Gosvami said:</p>
<p>yatha kancanatam yati</p>
<p>kamsyam rasa-vidhanatah</p>
<p>tatha diksa-vidhanena</p>
<p>dvijatvam jayate nrnam</p>
<p>As one can transform kamsa, or bell metal, into gold by treating it with mercury, one can also turn a lowborn man into a brahmana by initiating him properly into Vaisnava activities The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is trying to turn mlecchas and yavanas into real brahmanas by properly initiating them and stopping them from engaging in meat-eating, intoxication, illicit sex and gambling.</p>
<p>One who stops these four principles of sinful activity and chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra can certainly become a pure brahmana through the process of bona fide initiation, as suggested by Srila Sanatana Gosvami.</p>
<p>Apart from this, if one takes a hint from this verse and learns how to mix mercury with bell metal by properly heating and melting them, one can get gold very cheaply.</p>
<p>The alchemists of the medieval age tried to manufacture gold, but they were unsuccessful, perhaps because they did not follow the right instructions.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatah adhastat—beneath the plane known as Vitala; sutale—on the planet known as Sutala; udara-sravah—very greatly celebrated; punya-slokah—very pious and advanced in spiritual consciousness; virocana-atmajah—the son of Virocana; balih—Bali Maharaja; bhagavata—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; maha-indrasya—of the King of heaven, Indra; priyam—the welfare; cikirsamanena—desiring to perform; aditeh—from Aditi; labdha-kayah—having obtained His body; bhutva—appearing; vatu—brahmacari; vamana-rupena—in the form of a dwarf; paraksipta—wrested away; loka-trayah—the three worlds; bhagavat-anukampaya—by the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; eva—certainly; punah—again; pravesitah—caused to enter; indra-adisu—even among the demigods like the King of heaven; avidyamanaya—not existing; susamrddhaya—much enriched by such exalted opulence; sriya—by good fortune; abhijustah—being blessed; sva-dharmena—by discharging devotional service; aradhayan—worshiping; tam—Him; eva—certainly; bhagavantam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; aradhaniyam—who is most worshipable; apagata-sadhvasah—without fear; aste—remains; adhuna api—even today.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Below the plane Vitala is another plane, known as Sutala, where the great son of Maharaja Virocana, Bali Maharaja, who is celebrated as the most pious king, resides even now.</p>
<p>For the welfare of Indra, the King of heaven, Lord Visnu appeared in the form of a dwarf brahmacari as the son of Aditi and tricked Bali Maharaja by begging for only three paces of land but taking all the three worlds.</p>
<p>Being very pleased with Bali Maharaja for giving all his possessions, the Lord returned his kingdom and made him richer than the opulent King Indra.</p>
<p>Even now, Bali Maharaja engages in devotional service by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the plane of Sutala.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as Uttamasloka, He who is worshiped by the best of selected Sanskrit verses and His devotees such as Bali Maharaja are also worshiped by punya-sloka, verses that increase one’s piety.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja offered everything to the Lord—his wealth, his kingdom and even his own body (sarvatma-nivedane balih).</p>
<p>The Lord appeared before Bali Maharaja as a brahmana beggar, and Bali Maharaja gave Him everything he had.</p>
<p>However, Bali Maharaja did not become poor; by donating all his possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a successful devotee and got everything back again with the blessings of the Lord.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who give contributions to expand the activities of the Krsna consciousness movement and to accomplish its objectives will never be losers; they will get their wealth back with the blessings of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>On the other side, those who collect contributions on behalf of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness should be very careful not to use even a farthing of the collection for any purpose other than the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>no—not; eva—indeed; etat—this; saksatkarah—the direct result; bhumi-danasya—of contribution of land; yat—which; tat—that; bhagavati—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; asesa-jiva-nikayanam—of unlimited numbers of living entities; jiva-bhuta-atma-bhute—who is the life and the Supersoul; parama-atmani—the supreme regulator; vasudeve—Lord Vasudeva (Krsna); tirtha-tame—who is the best of all places of pilgrimage; patre—the most worthy recipient; upapanne—having approached; paraya—by the topmost; sraddhaya—faith; parama-adara—with great respect; samahita-manasa—with an attentive mind; sampratipaditasya—which was given; saksat—directly; apavarga-dvarasya—the gate of liberation; yat—which; bila-nilaya—of bila-svarga, the imitation heavenly planes; aisvaryam—the opulence.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, Bali Maharaja donated all his possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vamanadeva, but one should certainly not conclude that he achieved his great worldly opulence in bila-svarga as a result of his charitable disposition.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of life for all living entities, lives within everyone as the friendly Supersoul, and under His direction a living entity enjoys or suffers in the material world.</p>
<p>Greatly appreciating the transcendental qualities of the Lord, Bali Maharaja offered everything at His lotus feet.</p>
<p>His purpose, however, was not to gain anything material, but to become a pure devotee.</p>
<p>For a pure devotee, the door of liberation is automatically opened.</p>
<p>One should not think that Bali Maharaja was given so much material opulence merely because of his charity.</p>
<p>When one becomes a pure devotee in love, he may also be blessed with a good material position by the will of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>However, one should not mistakenly think that the material opulence of a devotee is the result of his devotional service.</p>
<p>The real result of devotional service is the awakening of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which continues under all circumstances.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.20</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yasya—of whom; ha vava—indeed; ksuta—when in hunger; patana—falling down; praskhalana-adisu—stumbling and so on; vivasah—being helpless; sakrt—once; nama abhigrnan—chanting the holy name of the Lord; purusah—a person; karma-bandhanam—the bondage of fruitive activity; anjasa—completely; vidhunoti—washes away; yasya—of which; ha—certainly; eva—in this way; pratibadhanam—the repulsion; mumuksavah—persons desiring liberation; anyatha—otherwise; eva—certainly; upalabhante—are trying to realize.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If one who is embarrassed by hunger or who falls down or stumbles chants the holy name of the Lord even once, willingly or unwillingly, he is immediately freed from the reactions of his past deeds.</p>
<p>Karmis entangled in material activities face many difficulties in the practice of mystic yoga and other endeavors to achieve that same freedom.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not a fact that one has to offer his material possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be liberated before he can engage in devotional service.</p>
<p>A devotee automatically attains liberation without separate endeavors.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja did not get back all his material possessions merely because of his charity to the Lord.</p>
<p>One who becomes a devotee, free from material desires and motives, regards all opportunities, both material and spiritual, as benedictions from the Lord, and in this way his service to the Lord is never hampered.</p>
<p>Bhukti, material enjoyment, and mukti, liberation, are only by-products of devotional service.</p>
<p>A devotee need not work separately to attain mukti.</p>
<p>Srila Bilvamangala Thakura said, muktih svayam mukulitanjalih sevate ’sman: a pure devotee of the Lord does not have to endeavor separately for mukti, because mukti is always ready to serve him.</p>
<p>In this regard, Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya3.177–188) describes Haridasa Thakura’s confirmation of the effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord keha bale——‘nama haite haya papa-ksaya’</p>
<p>keha bale——‘nama haite jivera moksa haya’</p>
<p>Some say that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one is freed from all the reactions of sinful life, and others say that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one attains liberation from material bondage haridasa kahena,——namera ei dui phala naya</p>
<p>namera phale krsna-pade prema upajaya</p>
<p>Haridasa Thakura, however, said that the desired result of chanting the holy name of the Lord is not that one is liberated from material bondage or freed from the reactions of sinful life.</p>
<p>The actual result of chanting the holy name of the Lord is that one awakens his dormant Krsna consciousness, his loving service to the Lord anusangika phala namera——‘mukti’, ‘papa-nasa’</p>
<p>tahara drstanta yaiche suryera prakasa</p>
<p>Haridasa Thakura said that liberation and freedom from the reactions of sinful activities are only by-products of chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>If one chants the holy name of the Lord purely, he attains the platform of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In this regard Haridasa Thakura gave an example comparing the power of the holy name to sunshine</p>
<p>ei slokera artha kara panditera gan</p>
<p>sabe kahe,——‘tumi kaha artha-vivarana’</p>
<p>He placed a verse before all the learned scholars present, but the learned scholars asked him to state the purport of the verse haridasa kahena,——yaiche suryera udaya</p>
<p>udaya na haite arambhe tamera haya ksaya</p>
<p>Haridasa Thakura said that as the sun begins to rise, it dissipates the darkness of night, even before the sunshine is visible caura-preta-raksasadira bhaya haya nasa</p>
<p>udaya haile dharma-karma-adi parakasa</p>
<p>Before the sunrise even takes place, the light of dawn destroys the fear of the dangers of the night, such as disturbances by thieves, ghosts and Raksasas, and when the sunshine actually appears, one engages in his duties aiche namodayarambhe papa-adira ksaya</p>
<p>udaya kaile krsna-pade haya premodaya</p>
<p>Similarly, even before one’s chanting of the holy name is pure, one is freed from all sinful reactions, and when he chants purely he becomes a lover of Krsna ‘mukti’ tuccha-phala haya namabhasa haite</p>
<p>ye mukti bhakta na laya, se krsna cahe dit</p>
<p>A devotee never accepts mukti, even if Krsna offers it.</p>
<p>Mukti, freedom from all sinful reactions, is obtained even by namabhasa, or a glimpse of the light of the holy name before its full light is perfectly visible.</p>
<p>The namabhasa stage is between that of nama-aparadha, or chanting of the holy name with offenses, and pure chanting.</p>
<p>There are three stages in chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the first stage, one commits ten kinds of offenses while chanting.</p>
<p>In the next stage, namabhasa, the offenses have almost stopped, and one is coming to the platform of pure chanting.</p>
<p>In the third stage, when one chants the Hare Krsna mantra without offenses, his dormant love for Krsna immediately awakens.</p>
<p>This is the perfection.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.21</strong></p>
<p>tad bhaktanam atmavatam sarvesam atmany atmada atmatayaiva.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—that; bhaktanam—of great devotees; atma-vatam—of self-realized persons like Sanaka and Sanatana; sarvesam—of all; atmani—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the soul; atma-de—who gives Himself without hesitation; atmataya—who is the Supreme Soul, Paramatma; eva—indeed.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul, sells Himself to His devotees such as Narada Muni.</p>
<p>In other words, the Lord gives pure love to such devotees and gives Himself to those who love Him purely.</p>
<p>Great, self-realized mystic yogis such as the four Kumaras also derive great transcendental bliss from realizing the Supersoul within themselves.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord became Bali Maharaja’s doorkeeper not because of his giving everything to the Lord, but because of his exalted position as a lover of the Lord.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.22</strong></p>
<p>na vai bhagavan nunam amusyanujagraha yad uta punar atmanusmrti-mosanam mayamaya-bhogaisvaryam evatanuteti.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; vai—indeed; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nunam—certainly; amusya—unto Bali Maharaja; anujagraha—showed His favor; yat—because; uta—certainly; punah—again; atma-anusmrti—of remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; mosanam—which robs one; maya-maya—an attribute of Maya; bhoga-aisvaryam—the material opulence; eva—certainly; atanuta—extended; iti—thus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead did not award His mercy to Bali Maharaja by giving him material happiness and opulence, for these make one forget loving service to the Lord.</p>
<p>The result of material opulence is that one can no longer absorb his mind in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of opulence.</p>
<p>One, which results from one’s karma, is material, whereas the other is spiritual.</p>
<p>A surrendered soul who fully depends upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not want material opulence for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Therefore when a pure devotee is seen to possess exalted material opulence, it is not due to his karma.</p>
<p>Rather, it is due to his bhakti.</p>
<p>In other words, he is in that position because the Supreme Lord wants him to execute service to Him very easily and opulently.</p>
<p>The special mercy of the Lord for the neophyte devotee is that he becomes materially poor.</p>
<p>This is the Lord’s mercy because if a neophyte devotee becomes materially opulent, he forgets the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>However, if an advanced devotee is favored by the Lord with opulence, it is not material opulence but a spiritual opportunity.</p>
<p>Material opulence offered to the demigods causes forgetfulness of the Lord, but opulence was given to Bali Maharaja for continuing service to the Lord, which was free from any touch of maya.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat—which; tat—that; bhagavata—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; anadhigata-anya-upayena—who is not perceived by other means; yacna-chalena—by a trick of begging; apahrta—taken away; sva-sarira-avasesita—with only his own body remaining; loka-trayah—the three worlds; varuna-pasaih—by the ropes of Varuna; ca—and; sampratimuktah—completely bound; giri-daryam—in a cave in a mountain; ca—and; apaviddhah—being detained; iti—thus; ha—indeed; uvaca—said.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead could see no other means of taking everything away from Bali Maharaja, He adopted the trick of begging from him and took away all the three worlds.</p>
<p>Thus only his body was left, but the Lord was still not satisfied.</p>
<p>He arrested Bali Maharaja, bound him with the ropes of Varuna and threw him in a cave in a mountain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although all his property was taken and he was thrown into a cave, Bali Maharaja was such a great devotee that he spoke as follows.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.24</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nunam—certainly; bata—alas; ayam—this; bhagavan—very learned; arthesu—in self-interest; na—not; nisnatah—very experienced; yah—who; asau—the King of heaven; indrah—Indra; yasya—of whom; sacivah—the prime minister; mantraya—for giving instructions; vrtah—chosen; ekantatah—alone; brhaspatih—named Brhaspati; tam—him; atihaya—ignoring; svayam—personally; upendrena—by means of Upendra (Lord Vamanadeva); atmanam—myself; ayacata—requested; atmanah—for himself; ca—and; asisah—blessings (the three worlds); no—not; eva—certainly; tat-dasyam—the loving service of the Lord; ati—very; gambhira-vayasah—having an insurmountable duration; kalasya—of time; manvantara-parivrttam—changed by the end of a life of a Manu; kiyat—what is the value of; loka-trayam—three worlds; idam—these.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Alas, how pitiable it is for Indra, the King of heaven, that although he is very learned and powerful and although he chose Brhaspati as his prime minister to instruct him, he is completely ignorant concerning spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Brhaspati is also unintelligent because he did not properly instruct his disciple Indra.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva was standing at Indra’s door, but King Indra, instead of begging Him for an opportunity to render transcendental loving service, engaged Him in asking me for alms to gain the three worlds for his sense gratification.</p>
<p>Sovereignty over the three worlds is very insignificant because whatever material opulence one may possess lasts only for an age of Manu, which is but a tiny fraction of endless time.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was so powerful that he fought with Indra and took possession of the three worlds.</p>
<p>Indra was certainly very advanced in knowledge, but instead of asking Vamanadeva for engagement in His service, he used the Lord to beg for material possessions that would lie finished at the end of one age of Manu.</p>
<p>An age of Manu, which is the duration of Manu’s life, is calculated to last seventy-two yugas.</p>
<p>One yuga consists of 4,300,000 years, and therefore the duration of Manu’s life is 309,600,000 years.</p>
<p>The demigods possess their material opulence only until the end of the life of Manu.</p>
<p>Time is insurmountable.</p>
<p>The time one is allotted, even if it be millions of years, is quickly gone.</p>
<p>The demigods own their material possessions only within the limits of time.</p>
<p>Therefore Bali Maharaja lamented that although Indra was very learned, he did not know how to use his intelligence properly, for instead of asking Vamanadeva to allow him to engage in His service, Indra used Him to beg Bali Maharaja for material wealth.</p>
<p>Although Indra was learned and his prime minister, Brhaspati, was also learned, neither of them begged to be able to render loving service to Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Therefore Bali Maharaja lamented for Indra.</p>

<p>yasya—of whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); anudasyam—the service; eva—certainly; asmat—our; pita-mahah—grandfather; kila—indeed; vavre—accepted; na—not; tu—but; sva—own; pitryam—paternal property; yat—which; uta—certainly; akutah-bhayam—fearlessness; padam—position; diyamanam—being offered; bhagavatah—than the Supreme Personality of Godhead; param—other; iti—thus; bhagavata—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; uparate—when killed; khalu—indeed; sva-pitari—his own father.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja said: My grandfather Prahlada Maharaja is the only person who understood his own self-interest.</p>
<p>Upon the death of Prahlada’s father, Hiranyakasipu, Lord Nrsimhadeva wanted to offer Prahlada his father’s kingdom and even wanted to grant him liberation from material bondage, but Prahlada accepted neither.</p>
<p>Liberation and material opulence, he thought, are obstacles to devotional service, and therefore such gifts from the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not His actual mercy.</p>
<p>Consequently, instead of accepting the results of karma and jnana, Prahlada Maharaja simply begged the Lord for engagement in the service of His servant.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed that an unalloyed devotee should consider himself a servant of the servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord (gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah).</p>
<p>In Vaisnava philosophy, one should not even become a direct servant.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja was offered all the blessings of an opulent position in the material world and even the liberation of merging into Brahman, but he refused all this.</p>
<p>He simply wanted to engage in the service of the servant of the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore Bali Maharaja said that because his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja had rejected the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of material opulence and liberation from material bondage, he truly understood his self-interest.</p>



<p><strong>5.24.26</strong></p>
<p>tasya mahanubhavasyanupatham amrjita-kasayah ko vasmad-vidhah parihina-bhagavad-anugraha upajigamisatiti.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasya—of Prahlada Maharaja; maha-anubhavasya—who was an exalted devotee; anupatham—the path; amrjita-kasayah—a person who is materially contaminated; kah—what; va—or; asmat-vidhah—like us; parihina-bhagavat-anugrahah—being without the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; upajigamisati—desires to follow; iti—thus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja said: Persons like us, who are still attached to material enjoyment, who are contaminated by the modes of material nature and who lack the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot follow the supreme path of Prahlada Maharaja, the exalted devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that for spiritual realization one must follow great personalities like Lord Brahma, Devarsi Narada, Lord Siva and Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>The path of bhakti is not at all difficult if we follow in the footsteps of previous acaryas and authorities, but those who are too materially contaminated by the modes of material nature cannot follow them.</p>
<p>Although Bali Maharaja was actually following the path of his grandfather, because of his great humility he thought that he was not.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of advanced Vaisnavas following the principles of bhakti that they think themselves ordinary human beings.</p>
<p>This is not an artificial exhibition of humility; a Vaisnava sincerely thinks this way and therefore never admits his exalted position.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, how shall I glorify the character of Bali Maharaja? The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of the three worlds, who is most compassionate to His own devotee, stands with club in hand at Bali Maharaja’s door.</p>
<p>When Ravana, the powerful demon, came to gain victory over Bali Maharaja, Vamanadeva kicked him a distance of eighty thousand miles with His big toe.</p>
<p>I shall explain the character and activities of Bali Maharaja later (in the Eighth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Beneath the plane known as Sutala is another plane, called Talatala, which is ruled by the Danava demon named Maya.</p>
<p>Maya is known as the acarya (master) of all the mayavis, who can invoke the powers of sorcery.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the three worlds, Lord Siva, who is known as Tripurari, once set fire to the three kingdoms of Maya, but later, being pleased with him, he returned his kingdom.</p>
<p>Since that time, Maya Danava has been protected by Lord Siva, and therefore he falsely thinks that he need not fear the Sudarsana cakra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>When a female messenger from Indra named Sarama chants a particular curse, the serpentine demons of Mahatala become very afraid of Indra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that there was a great fight between these serpentine demons and Indra, the King of heaven.</p>
<p>When the defeated demons met the female messenger Sarama, who was chanting a mantra, they became afraid, and therefore they are living in the plane called Rasatala.</p>
