<p>In this chapter the spotless character of King Nabhi, the oldest son of Agnidhra, is described.</p>
<p>Wanting to have sons, Maharaja Nabhi underwent severe austerities and penances.</p>
<p>He performed many sacrifices along with his wife and worshiped Lord Visnu, master of all sacrifices.</p>
<p>Being very kind to His devotees, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was very pleased with the austerities of Maharaja Nabhi.</p>
<p>He personally appeared before the King in His four-handed feature, and the priests, who were performing the sacrifices, began to offer their prayers unto Him.</p>
<p>They prayed for a son like the Lord, and Lord Visnu agreed to take birth in the womb of Merudevi, the wife of King Nabhi, and incarnate as King Rsabhadeva.</p>
