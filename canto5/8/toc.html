<h1><a class="header" href="#a-description-of-the-character-of-bharata-maharaja" id="a-description-of-the-character-of-bharata-maharaja">A Description of the Character of Bharata Maharaja</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#58" id="58">5.8</a></strong></p>
<p>Although Bharata Maharaja was very elevated, he fell down due to his attachment to a young deer.</p>
<p>One day after Bharata Maharaja had taken his bath as usual in the River Gandaki and was chanting his mantra, he saw a pregnant deer come to the river to drink water.</p>
<p>Suddenly there could be heard the thundering roar of a lion, and the deer was so frightened that it immediately gave birth to its calf.</p>
<p>It then crossed the river, but died immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>Maharaja Bharata took compassion upon the motherless calf, rescued it from the water, took it to his asrama and cared for it affectionately.</p>
<p>He gradually became attached to this young deer and always thought of it affectionately.</p>
<p>As it grew up, it became Maharaja Bharata’s constant companion, and he always took care of it.</p>
<p>Gradually he became so absorbed in thinking of this deer that his mind became agitated.</p>
<p>As he became more attached to the deer, his devotional service slackened.</p>
<p>Although he was able to give up his opulent kingdom, he became attached to the deer.</p>
<p>Thus he fell down from his mystic yoga practice.</p>
<p>Once when the deer was absent, Maharaja Bharata was so disturbed that he began to search for it.</p>
<p>While searching and lamenting the deer’s absence, Maharaja Bharata fell down and died.</p>
<p>Because his mind was fully absorbed thinking of the deer, he naturally took his next birth from the womb of a deer.</p>
<p>However, because he was considerably advanced spiritually, he did not forget his past activities, even though he was in the body of a deer.</p>
<p>He could understand how he had fallen down from his exalted position, and remembering this, he left his mother deer and again went to Pulaha-asrama.</p>
<p>He finally ended his fruitive activities in the form of a deer, and when he died he was released from the deer’s body.</p>
