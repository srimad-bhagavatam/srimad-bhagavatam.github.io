<p>uktas tvaya bhu-mandalayama-viseso yavad adityas tapati yatra casau jyotisam ganais candrama va saha drsyate.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>raja uvaca—Maharaja Pariksit said; uktah—already been said; tvaya—by you; bhu-mandala—of the planetary system known as Bhu-mandala; ayama-visesah—the specific length of the radius; yavat—as far as; adityah—the sun; tapati—heats; yatra—wherever; ca—also; asau—that; jyotisam—of the luminaries; ganaih—with hordes; candrama—the moon; va—either; saha—with; drsyate—is seen.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pariksit said to Sukadeva Gosvami: O brahmana, you have already informed me that the radius of Bhu-mandala extends as far as the sun spreads its light and heat and as far as the moon and all the stars can be seen.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse it is stated that the planetary system known as Bhu-mandala extends to the limits of the sunshine.</p>
<p>According to modern science, the sunshine reaches earth from a distance of 93,000,000 miles.</p>
<p>If we calculate according to this modern information, 93,000,000 miles can be considered the radius of Bhu-mandala.</p>
<p>In the Gayatri mantra, we chant om bhur bhuvah svah.</p>
<p>The word bhur refers to Bhu-mandala.</p>
<p>Tat savitur varenyam: the sunshine spreads throughout Bhu-mandala.</p>
<p>Therefore the sun is worshipable.</p>
<p>The stars, which are known as naksatra, are not different suns, as modern astronomers suppose.</p>
<p>From Bhagavad-gita (10.21) we understand that the stars are similar to the moon (naksatranam aham sasi).</p>
<p>Like the moon, the stars reflect the sunshine.</p>
<p>Apart from our modern distinguished estimations of where the planetary systems are located, we can understand that the sky and its various planets were studied long, long before Srimad-Bhagavatam was compiled.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami explained the location of the planets, and this indicates that the information was known long, long before Sukadeva Gosvami related it to Maharaja Pariksit.</p>
<p>The location of the various planetary systems was not unknown to the sages who flourished in the Vedic age.</p>
