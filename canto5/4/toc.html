<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#54" id="54">5.4</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, Rsabhadeva, the son of Maharaja Nabhi, begot a hundred sons, and during the reign of those sons the world was very happy in all respects.</p>
<p>When Rsabhadeva appeared as the son of Maharaja Nabhi, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age.</p>
<p>His poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond compare.</p>
<p>The word rsabha refers to the best, or the supreme.</p>
<p>Due to the superexcellent attributes of the son of Maharaja Nabhi, the King named his son Rsabha, or the best His influence was incomparable.</p>
<p>Although there was a scarcity of rain, Rsabhadeva did not care for Indra, the King of heaven, who is in charge of supplying rain.</p>
<p>Through His own potency, Rsabhadeva sumptuously covered Ajanabha with ample rain.</p>
<p>Upon receiving Rsabhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King Nabhi began to raise Him very carefully.</p>
<p>After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring from family life, lived at Badarikasrama completely engaged in the worship of Vasudeva, the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>To follow social customs, Lord Rsabhadeva for a while became a student in the gurukula, and after returning.</p>
<p>He followed the orders of His guru and accepted a wife named Jayanti, who had been given to Him by the King of heaven, Indra.</p>
<p>He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayanti.</p>
<p>Of these hundred sons, the eldest was known as Bharata.</p>
<p>Since the reign of Maharaja Bharata, this planet has been called Bharata-varsa.</p>
<p>Rsabhadeva’s other sons were headed by Kusavarta, Ilavarta, Brahmavarta, Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indrasprk, Vidarbha and Kikata.</p>
<p>There were also other sons named Kavi, Havi, Antariksa, Prabuddha, Pippalayana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhajana.</p>
<p>Instead of ruling the kingdom, these nine became mendicant preachers of Krsna consciousness, following the religious precepts of the Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam during the talks between Vasudeva and Narada at Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>To teach the general populace, King Rsabhadeva performed many sacrifices and taught His sons how to rule the citizens.</p>

<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>atha ha tam utpattyaivabhivyajyamana-bhagaval-laksanam samyopasama-vairagyaisvarya-maha-vibhutibhir anudinam edhamananubhavam prakrtayah praja brahmana devatas cavani-tala-samavanayatitaram jagrdhuh.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; atha ha—thus (after the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared); tam—Him; utpattya—from the beginning of His appearance; eva—even; abhivyajyamana—distinctly manifested; bhagavat-laksanam—possessing the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; samya—equal to everyone; upasama—completely peaceful, in control of the senses and mind; vairagya—renunciation; aisvarya—opulences; maha-vibhutibhih—with great attributes; anudinam—day after day; edhamana—increasing; anubhavam—His power; prakrtayah—the ministers; prajah—the citizens; brahmanah—the learned scholars in full knowledge of Brahman; devatah—the demigods; ca—and; avani-tala—the surface of the globe; samavanaya—to rule; atitaram—greatly; jagrdhuh—desired.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: As soon as the Lord was born as the son of Maharaja Nabhi, He manifested symptoms of the Supreme Lord, such as marks on the bottoms of His feet (the flag, thunderbolt, etc.).</p>
<p>This son was equal to everyone and very peaceful.</p>
<p>He could control His senses and His mind, and, possessing all opulence, He did not hanker for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Endowed with all these attributes, the son of Maharaja Nabhi became more powerful day after day.</p>
<p>Due to this, the citizens, learned brahmanas, demigods and ministers wanted Rsabhadeva to be appointed ruler of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In these days of cheap incarnations, it is very interesting to note the bodily symptoms found in an incarnation.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of His birth, it was observed that Rsabhadeva’s feet were marked with the transcendental signs (a flag, thunderbolt, lotus flower, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition to this, as the Lord began to grow, He became very prominent.</p>
<p>He was equal to everyone.</p>
<p>He did not favor one person and neglect another.</p>
<p>An incarnation of God must have the six opulences—wealth strength, knowledge, beauty, fame and renunciation.</p>
<p>It is said that although Rsabhadeva was endowed with all opulences, He was not at all attached to material enjoyment.</p>
<p>He was self-controlled and therefore liked by everyone.</p>
<p>Due to His superexcellent qualities, everyone wanted Him to rule the earth.</p>
<p>An incarnation of God has to be accepted by experienced people and by the symptoms described in the sastras.</p>
<p>An incarnation is not accepted simply by the adulation of foolish people.</p>
