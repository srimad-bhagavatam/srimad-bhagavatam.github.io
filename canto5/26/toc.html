<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#526" id="526">5.26</a></strong></p>
<p>The Twenty-sixth Chapter describes how a sinful man goes to different hells, where he is punished in various ways by the assistants of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>As stated in the Bhagavad-gita (3.27):</p>
<p>prakrteh kriyamanani</p>
<p>gunaih karmani sarvasah</p>
<p>ahankara-vimudhatma</p>
<p>kartaham iti manyate</p>
<p>The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature The foolish person thinks he is independent of any law.</p>
<p>He thinks there is no God or regulative principle and that he can do whatever he likes.</p>
<p>Thus he engages in different sinful activities, and as a result, he is put into different hellish conditions life after life, to be punished by the laws of nature.</p>
<p>The basic principle of his suffering is that he foolishly thinks himself independent, although he is strictly under the control of the laws of material nature.</p>
<p>These laws act due to the influence of the three modes of nature, and therefore each human being also works under three different types of influence.</p>
<p>According to how he acts, he suffers different reactions in his next life or in this life.</p>
<p>Religious persons act differently from atheists, and therefore they suffer different reactions.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami describes the following twenty-eight hells: Tamisra, Andhatamisra, Raurava, Maharaurava, Kumbhipaka.</p>
<p>Kalasutra, Asi-patravana, Sukaramukha, Andhakupa, Krmibhojana.</p>
<p>Sandamsa, Taptasurmi, Vajrakantaka-salmali, Vaitarani, Puyoda, Pranarodha, Visasana, Lalabhaksa, Sarameyadana, Avici, Ayahpana.</p>
<p>Ksarakardama, Raksogana-bhojana, Sulaprota, Dandasuka.</p>
<p>Avata-nirodhana, Paryavartana and Sucimukha.</p>
<p>A person who steals another’s money, wife or possessions is put into the hell known as Tamisra.</p>
<p>A man who tricks someone and enjoys his wife is put into the extremely hellish condition known as Andhatamisra.</p>
<p>A foolish person absorbed in the bodily concept of life, who on the basis of this principle maintains himself or his wife and children by committing violence against other living entities, is put into the hell known as Raurava.</p>
<p>There the animals he killed take birth as creatures called rurus and cause great suffering for him.</p>
<p>Those who kill different animals and birds and then cook them are put by the agents of Yamaraja into the hell known as Kumbhipaka, where they are boiled in oil.</p>
<p>A person who kills a brahmana is put into the hell known as Kalasutra, where the land, perfectly level and made of copper, is as hot as an oven.</p>
<p>The killer of a brahmana burns in that land for many years.</p>
<p>One who does not follow scriptural injunctions but who does everything whimsically or follows some rascal is put into the hell known as Asi-patravana.</p>
<p>A government official who poorly administers justice, or who punishes an innocent man, is taken by the assistants of Yamaraja to the hell known as Sukaramukha, where he is mercilessly beaten.</p>
<p>God has given advanced consciousness to the human being.</p>
<p>Therefore he can feel the suffering and happiness of other living beings.</p>
<p>The human being bereft of his conscience, however, is prone to cause suffering for other living beings.</p>
<p>The assistants of Yamaraja put such a person into the hell known as Andhakupa, where he receives proper punishment from his victims.</p>

<p>A person born into an aristocratic or highly placed family but who does not act accordingly is put into the hellish trench of blood, pus and urine called the Vaitarani River.</p>
<p>One who lives like an animal is put into the hell called Puyoda.</p>
<p>A person who mercilessly kills animals in the forest without sanction is put into the hell called Pranarodha.</p>

<p>After describing the hellish planets, Sukadeva Gosvami describes how pious persons are elevated to the highest planetary system, where the demigods live, and how they then come back again to this earth when the results of their pious activities are finished.</p>
<p>Finally he describes the universal form of the Lord and glorifies the Lord’s activities.</p>
