<p><strong>5.20.2</strong></p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>jambu-dvipah—Jambudvipa, the island named Jambu; ayam—this; yavat-pramana-vistarah—as much as the measure of its width, namely 100,000 yojanas (one yojana equals eight miles); tavata—so much; ksara-udadhina—by the ocean of salt water; parivestitah—surrounded; yatha—just as; meruh—Sumeru Mountain; jambu-akhyena—by the island named Jambu; lavana-udadhih—the ocean of salt water; api—certainly; tatah—thereafter; dvi-guna-visalena—which is twice as wide; plaksa-akhyena—by the island named Plaksa; pariksiptah—surrounded; yatha—like; parikha—a moat; bahya—external; upavanena—by a gardenlike forest; plaksah—a plaksa tree; jambu-pramanah—having the height of the jambu tree; dvipa-akhya-karah—causing the name of the island; hiranmayah—magnificently splendorous; utthitah—rising; yatra—where; agnih—a fire; upaste—is situated; sapta-jihvah—having seven flames; tasya—of that island; adhipatih—the king or master; priyavrata-atmajah—the son of King Priyavrata; idhma-jihvah—named Idhmajihva; svam—own; dvipam—island; sapta—seven; varsani—tracts of land; vibhajya—dividing into; sapta-varsa-namabhyah—for whom the seven tracts of land were named; atmajebhyah—to his own sons; akalayya—offering; svayam—personally; atma-yogena—by the devotional service of the Lord; upararama—he retired from all material activities.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As Sumeru Mountain is surrounded by Jambudvipa, Jambudvipa is also surrounded by an ocean of salt water.</p>
<p>The breadth of Jambudvipa is 100,000 yojanas (800,000 miles), and the breadth of the saltwater ocean is the same.</p>
<p>As a moat around a fort is sometimes surrounded by gardenlike forest, the saltwater ocean surrounding Jambudvipa is itself surrounded by Plaksadvipa.</p>
<p>The breadth of Plaksadvipa is twice that of the saltwater ocean—in other words 260,000 yojanas (1,600,000 miles).</p>
<p>On Plaksadvipa there is a tree shining like gold and as tall as the jambu tree on Jambudvipa.</p>
<p>At its root is a fire with seven flames.</p>
<p>It is because this tree is a plaksa tree that the island is called Plaksadvipa.</p>
<p>Plaksadvipa was governed by Idhmajihva, one of the sons of Maharaja Priyavrata.</p>
<p>He endowed the seven islands with the names of his seven sons, divided the islands among the sons, and then retired from active life to engage in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The seven islands (varsas) are named according to the names of those seven sons—Siva, Yavasa, Subhadra, Santa, Ksema, Amrta and Abhaya.</p>
<p>In those seven tracts of land, there are seven mountains and seven rivers.</p>
<p>The mountains are named Manikuta, Vajrakuta, Indrasena, Jyotisman, Suparna, Hiranyasthiva and Meghamala, and the rivers are named Aruna, Nrmna, Angirasi, Savitri, Suptabhata, Rtambhara and Satyambhara.</p>
<p>One can immediately be free from material contamination by touching or bathing in those rivers, and the four castes of people who live in Plaksadvipa—the Hamsas, Patangas, Urdhvayanas and Satyangas—purify themselves in that way.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Plaksadvipa live for one thousand years.</p>
<p>They are beautiful like the demigods, and they also beget children like the demigods.</p>
<p>By completely performing the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead as represented by the sun-god, they attain the sun, which is a heavenly plane.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to general understanding, there are originally three deities—Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and Lord Siva—and people with a poor fund of knowledge consider Lord Visnu no better than Lord Brahma or Lord Siva.</p>
<p>This conclusion, however, is invalid.</p>
<p>As stated in the Vedas, istapurtam bahudha jayamanam visvam bibharti bhuvanasya nabhih tad evagnis tad vayus tat suryas tad u candramah agnih sarvadaivatah.</p>
<p>This means that the Supreme Lord, who accepts and enjoys the results of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies (technically called istapurta), who maintains the entire creation, who supplies the necessities of all living entities (eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman) and who is the central point of all creation, is Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu expands as the demigods known as Agni, Vayu, Surya and Candra, who are simply parts and parcels of His body.</p>
<p>Srimad Bhagavad-gita (9.23):</p>
<p>ye ’py anya-devata-bhakta</p>
<p>yajante sraddhayanvitah</p>
<p>te ’pi mam eva kaunteya</p>
<p>yajanty avidhi-purvakam</p>
<p>Devotees who worship the demigods with firm faith worship Me also, but not according to regulative principles In other words, if one worships the demigods but does not understand the relationship between the demigods and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his worship is irregular.</p>
<p>Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita (9.24), aham hi sarva-yajnanam bhokta ca prabhur eva ca: I am the only enjoyer of ritualistic ceremonies It may be argued that the demigods are as important as Lord Visnu because the names of the demigods are different names of Visnu.</p>
<p>This, however, is not a sound conclusion, for it is contradicted in the Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>The Vedas declare:</p>
<p>candrama manaso jatas caksoh suryo ajayata; srotradayas ca pranas ca mukhad agnir ajayata; narayanad brahma, narayanad rudro jayate, narayanat prajapatih jayate, narayanad indro jayate, narayanad astau vasavo jayante, narayanad ekadasa rudra jayante</p>
<p>The demigod of the moon, Candra, came from the mind of Narayana, and the sun-god came from His eyes.</p>
<p>The controlling deities of hearing and the life air came from Narayana, and the controlling deity of fire was generated from His mouth.</p>
<p>Prajapati, Lord Brahma, came from Narayana, Indra came from Narayana, and the eight Vasus, the eleven expansions of Lord Siva and the twelve Adityas also came from Narayana In the smrti Vedic literature it is also said:</p>
<p>brahma sambhus tathaivarkas</p>
<p>candramas ca satakratuh</p>
<p>evam adyas tathaivanye</p>
<p>yukta vaisnava-tejasa</p>
<p>jagat-karyavasane tu</p>
<p>viyujyante ca tejasa</p>
<p>vitejas ca te sarve</p>
<p>pancatvam upayanti te</p>
<p>Brahma, Sambhu, Surya and Indra are all merely products of the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is also true of the many other demigods whose names are not mentioned here.</p>
<p>When the cosmic manifestation is annihilated, these different expansions of Narayana’s potencies will merge into Narayana.</p>
<p>In other words, all these demigods will die.</p>
<p>Their living force will be withdrawn, and they will merge into Narayana Therefore it should be concluded that Lord Visnu, not Lord Brahma or Lord Siva, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As a government officer is sometimes accepted as the entire government although he is actually but a departmental manager, so the demigods, having achieved power of attorney from Visnu, act on His behalf, although they are not as powerful as He.</p>
<p>All the demigods must work under the orders of Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya.</p>
<p>The only master is Lord Krsna, or Lord Visnu, and all others are His obedient servants, who act exactly according to His orders.</p>
<p>The distinction between Lord Visnu and the demigods is also expressed in Bhagavad-gita (9.25).</p>
<p>Yanti deva-vrata devan yanti mad-yajino ’pi mam: those who worship the demigods go to the planes of the demigods, whereas the worshipers of Lord Krsna and Lord Visnu go to the planes in Vaikuntha.</p>
<p>These are the statements of the smrti.</p>
<p>Therefore the idea that Lord Visnu is on the same level as the demigods is in contradiction to the sastras.</p>
<p>The demigods are not supreme.</p>
<p>The supremacy of the demigods is dependent on the mercy of Lord Narayana (Visnu, or Krsna).</p>



<p><strong>5.20.5</strong></p>
<p>pratnasya visno rupam yat</p>
<p>satyasyartasya brahmanah</p>
<p>amrtasya ca mrtyos ca</p>
<p>suryam atmanam imahiti</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>pratnasya—of the oldest person; visnoh—Lord Visnu; rupam—the form; yat—which; satyasya—of the Absolute Truth; rtasya—of dharma; brahmanah—of the Supreme Brahman; amrtasya—of the auspicious result; ca—and; mrtyoh—of death (the inauspicious result); ca—and; suryam—the demigod Surya; atmanam—the Supersoul or origin of all souls; imahi—we approach for shelter; iti—thus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(This is the mantra by which the inhabitants of Plaksadvipa worship the Supreme Lord.)</p>
<p>Let us take shelter of the sun-god, who is a reflection of Lord Visnu, the all-expanding Supreme Personality of Godhead, the oldest of all persons.</p>
<p>Visnu is the only worshipable Lord.</p>
<p>He is the Vedas, He is religion, and He is the origin of all auspicious and inauspicious results.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Visnu is even the Supreme Lord of death, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mrtyuh sarva-haras caham).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of activity—auspicious and inauspicious—and both are controlled by Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Inauspicious activities are said to be behind Lord Visnu, whereas auspicious activities stand before Him.</p>
<p>The auspicious and the inauspicious exist throughout the entire world, and Lord Visnu is the controller of them both.</p>
<p>In regard to this verse, Srila Madhvacarya says:</p>
<p>surya-somagni-varisa-</p>
<p>vidhatrsu yatha-kramam</p>
<p>plaksadi-dvipa-samsthasu</p>
<p>sthitam harim upasate</p>
<p>There are many lands, fields, mountains and oceans throughout the creation, and everywhere the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by His different names.</p>
<p>Srila Viraraghava Acarya explains this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam as follows.</p>
<p>The original cause of the cosmic manifestation must be the oldest person and must therefore be beyond material transformations.</p>
<p>He is the enjoyer of all auspicious activities and is the cause of conditional life and also liberation.</p>
<p>The demigod Surya, who is categorized as a very powerful jiva, or living entity, is a representation of one of the parts of His body.</p>
<p>We are naturally subordinate to powerful living entities, and therefore we can worship the various demigods as living beings who are powerful representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Although the worship of the sun-god is recommended in this mantra, He is worshiped not as the Supreme Personality of Godhead but as His powerful representative.</p>
<p>Katha Upanisad (1.3.1) it is said:</p>
<p>rtam pibantau sukrtasya loke</p>
<p>guham pravistau parame parardhe</p>
<p>chayatapau brahmavido vadanti</p>
<p>pancagnayo ye ca tri-naciketah</p>
<p>O Naciketa, the expansions of Lord Visnu as the tiny living entity and the Supersoul are both situated within the cave of the heart of this body.</p>
<p>Having entered that cavity, the living entity, resting on the chief of the life airs, enjoys the results of activities, and the Supersoul, acting as witness enables him to enjoy them.</p>
<p>Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.16) it is said:</p>
<p>sa visvakrd visvavidatmayonih</p>
<p>jnah kalakaro guni sarvavid yah</p>
<p>pradhana-ksetrajna-patir gunesah</p>
<p>samsara-moksa-sthiti-bandha-hetuh</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, the creator of this cosmic manifestation, knows every nook and corner of His creation.</p>
<p>Although He is the cause of creation, there is no cause for His appearance.</p>
<p>He is fully aware of everything.</p>
<p>Taittiriya Upanisad (2.8) it is said:</p>
<p>bhisasmad vatah pavate</p>
<p>bhisodeti suryah</p>
<p>bhisasmad agnis candras ca</p>
<p>mrtyur dhavati pancamah</p>
<p>It is out of fear of the Supreme Brahman that the wind is blowing, out of fear of Him that the sun regularly rises and sets, and out of fear of Him that fire acts.</p>
<p>It is only due to fear of Him that death and Indra, the King of heaven, perform their respective duties As described in this chapter, the inhabitants of the five islands beginning with Plaksadvipa worship the sun-god, the moon-god, the fire-god, the air-god and Lord Brahma respectively.</p>
<p>Although they engage in the worship of these five demigods, however, they actually worship Lord Visnu, the Supersoul of all living entities, as indicated in this verse by the words pratnasya visno rupam.</p>
<p>Visnu is brahma, amrta, mrtyu—the Supreme Brahman and the origin of everything, auspicious and inauspicious.</p>
<p>He is situated in the heart of everyone, including all the demigods.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah prapadyante ’nya devatah: those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto the demigods.</p>
<p>People who are almost blind because of lusty desires are recommended to worship the demigods to have their material desires fulfilled, but actually those desires are not fulfilled by the material demigods.</p>
<p>Whatever the demigods do is done with the sanction of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>People who are too lusty worship various demigods instead of worshiping Lord Visnu, the Supersoul of all living entities, but ultimately it is Lord Visnu they worship because He is the Supersoul of all demigods.</p>



<p><strong>5.20.6</strong></p>
<p>plaksadisu pancasu purusanam ayur indriyam ojah saho balam buddhir vikrama iti ca sarvesam autpattiki siddhir avisesena vartate.</p>

<p><strong>5.20.8</strong></p>

<p>Learned scholars say that this gigantic tree is the residence of Garuda, the king of all birds and carrier of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>In that tree, Garuda offers Lord Visnu his Vedic prayers.</p>



<p><strong>5.20.9</strong></p>

<p>Outside the ocean of liquor is another island, known as Kusadvipa, which is 800,000 yojanas (6,400,000 miles) wide, twice as wide as the ocean of liquor.</p>
<p>As Salmalidvipa is surrounded by a liquor ocean, Kusadvipa is surrounded by an ocean of liquid ghee as broad as the island itself.</p>
<p>On Kusadvipa there are clumps of kusa grass, from which the island takes its name.</p>
<p>This kusa grass, which was created by the demigods by the will of the Supreme Lord, appears like a second form of fire, but with very mild and pleasing flames.</p>
<p>Its young shoots illuminate all directions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the descriptions in this verse, we can make an educated guess about the nature of the flames on the moon.</p>
<p>Like the sun, the moon must also be full of flames because without flames there cannot be illumination.</p>
<p>The flames on the moon, however, unlike those on the sun, must be mild and pleasing.</p>
<p>This is our conviction.</p>
<p>The modern theory that the moon is full of dust is not accepted in the verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>In regard to this verse, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, susaspani sukomala-sikhas tesam rocisa: the kusa grass illuminates all directions, but its flames are very mild and pleasing.</p>
<p>This gives some idea of the flames existing on the moon.</p>

<p>By bathing in the waters of those rivers, they all become purified.</p>
<p>They are expert in performing ritualistic ceremonies according to the orders of the Vedic scriptures.</p>
<p>Thus they worship the Lord in His aspect as the demigod of fire.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>parasya—of the Supreme; brahmanah—Brahman; saksat—directly; jata-vedah—O fire-god; asi—you are; havyavat—the carrier of Vedic offerings of grains and ghee; devanam—of all the demigods; purusa-anganam—who are limbs of the Supreme Person; yajnena—by performing the ritualistic sacrifices; purusam—to the Supreme person; yaja—please carry oblations; iti—thus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(This is the mantra by which the inhabitants of Kusadvipa worship the fire-god.)</p>
<p>O fire-god, you are a part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, and you carry to Him all the offerings of sacrifices.</p>
<p>Therefore we request you to offer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead the yajnic ingredients we are offering the demigods, for the Lord is the real enjoyer.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods are servants who assist the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If one worships the demigods, the demigods, as servants of the Supreme, carry the sacrificial offerings to the Lord, like tax collectors collecting revenue from the citizens and bringing it to the government’s treasury.</p>
<p>The demigods cannot accept the sacrificial offerings; they simply carry the offerings to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As stated by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah:  since the guru is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he carries to the Lord whatever is offered to him.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the demigods, as faithful servants of the Supreme Lord, hand over to the Supreme Lord whatever is offered to them in sacrificial performances.</p>
<p>There is no fault in worshiping the demigods with this understanding, but to think that the demigods are independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and equal to Him is called hrta-jnana, a loss of intelligence (kamais tais tair hrta jnanah (Bg.7.20)).</p>
<p>One who thinks that the demigods themselves are the actual benefactors is mistaken.</p>

<p>As Kusadvipa is surrounded by an ocean of clarified butter, Krauncadvipa is surrounded by an ocean of milk as broad as the island itself.</p>
<p>On Krauncadvipa there is a great mountain known as Kraunca, from which the island takes its name.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p>The ruler of this island was another son of Maharaja Priyavrata.</p>
<p>His name was Ghrtaprstha, and he was a very learned scholar.</p>
<p>He also divided his own island among his seven sons.</p>
<p>After dividing the island into seven parts, named according to the names of his sons, Ghrtaprstha Maharaja completely retired from family life and took shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, the soul of all souls, who has all auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>Thus he attained perfection.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, apomayah asmayam: with joined palms the inhabitants of the various sections of Krauncadvipa offer the sanctified waters of the rivers to a deity made of stone or iron.</p>

<p>Therefore you purify the three planeary systems, known as Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka.</p>
<p>By your constitutional nature, you take away sins, and that is why we are touching you.</p>
<p>Kindly continue to purify us.</p>

<p>Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these eight comprise My separated material energies.</p>
<p>The energy of the Lord acts throughout the creation, just as heat and light, the energies of the sun, act within the universe and make everything work.</p>
<p>The specific rivers mentioned in the sastras are also energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and people who regularly bathe in them are purified.</p>
<p>It can actually be seen that many people are cured of diseases simply by bathing in the Ganges.</p>
<p>Similarly, the inhabitants of Krauncadvipa purify themselves by bathing in the rivers there.</p>

<p>In Sakadvipa there is a big saka tree, from which the island takes its name.</p>
<p>This tree is very fragrant.</p>

<p>In the middle of that island is a great mountain named Manasottara, which forms the boundary between the inner side and the outer side of the island.</p>
<p>Its breadth and height are 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles).</p>
<p>On that mountain, in the four directions, are the residential quarters of demigods such as Indra.</p>
<p>In the chariot of the sun-god, the sun travels on the top of the mountain in an orbit called the Samvatsara, encircling Mount Meru.</p>
<p>The sun’s path on the northern side is called Uttarayana, and its path on the southern side is called Daksinayana.</p>
<p>One side represents a day for the demigods, and the other represents their night.</p>

<p>The sun orbits around Mount Sumeru, for six months on the northern side and for six months on the southern.</p>
<p>This adds up to the duration of a day and night of the demigods in the upper planeary systems.</p>

<p>They offer prayers to the Lord as follows.</p>



<p><strong>5.20.33</strong></p>
<p>yat tat karmamayam lingam</p>
<p>brahma-lingam jano ’rcayet</p>
<p>ekantam advayam santam</p>
<p>tasmai bhagavate nama iti</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat—which; tat—that; karma-mayam—obtainable by the Vedic ritualistic system; lingam—the form; brahma-lingam—which makes known the Supreme Brahman; janah—a person; arcayet—must worship; ekantam—who has full faith in the one Supreme; advayam—nondifferent; santam—peaceful; tasmai—unto him; bhagavate—the most powerful; namah—our respects; iti—thus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma is known as karma-maya, the form of ritualistic ceremonies, because by performing ritualistic ceremonies one may attain his position and because the Vedic ritualistic hymns become manifest from him.</p>
<p>He is devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead without deviation, and therefore in one sense he is not different from the Lord.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he should be worshiped not as the monists worship him, but in duality.</p>
<p>One should always remain a servitor of the Supreme Lord, the supreme worshipable Deity.</p>
<p>We therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Brahma, the form of manifest Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the word karma-mayam (obtainable by the Vedic ritualistic syste) is significant.</p>
<p>The Vedas say, svadharma-nisthah sata janmabhih puman virincatam eti: One who strictly follows the principles of varnasrama-dharma for at least one hundred births will be rewarded with the post of Lord Brahma It is also significant that although Lord Brahma is extremely powerful, he never thinks himself one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he always knows that he is an eternal servitor of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because the Lord and the servant are identical on the spiritual platform, Brahma is herein addressed as bhagavan.Bhagavan is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, but if a devotee serves Him with full faith, the meaning of the Vedic literature is revealed to him.</p>
<p>Therefore Brahma is called brahma-linga, which indicates that his entire form consists of Vedic knowledge.</p>

<p>In that tract of land there are many living beings.</p>
<p>Beyond it, extending to Lokaloka Mountain, is another land, which is made of gold.</p>
<p>Because of its golden surface, it reflects light like the surface of a mirror, and any physical article that falls on that land can never be perceived again.</p>
<p>All living entities, therefore, have abandoned that golden land.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—that mountain; loka-traya-ante—at the end of the three lokas (Bhurloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka); paritah—all around; isvarena—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna; vihitah—created; yasmat—from which; surya-adinam—of the sun plane; dhruva-apavarganam—up to Dhruvaloka and other, inferior luminaries; jyotih-gananam—of all the luminaries; gabhastayah—the rays; arvacinan—on this side; trin—the three; lokan—planeary systems; avitanvanah—spreading throughout; na—not; kadacit—at any time; paracinah—beyond the jurisdiction of that mountain; bhavitum—to be; utsahante—are able; tavat—that much; unnahana-ayamah—the measure of the height of the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By the supreme will of Krsna, the mountain known as Lokaloka has been installed as the outer border of the three worlds—Bhurloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka—to control the rays of the sun throughout the universe.</p>
<p>All the luminaries, from the sun up to Dhruvaloka, distribute their rays throughout the three worlds, but only within the boundary formed by this mountain.</p>
<p>Because it is extremely high, extending even higher than Dhruvaloka, it blocks the rays of the luminaries, which therefore can never extend beyond it.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When we speak of loka-traya, we refer to the three primary planeary systems—Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah—into which the universe is divided.</p>
<p>Surrounding these planeary systems are the eight directions, namely east, west, north, south, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest.</p>
<p>Lokaloka Mountain has been established as the outer boundary of all the lokas to distribute the rays of the sun and other luminaries equally throughout the universe.</p>
<p>This vivid description of how the rays of the sun are distributed throughout the different planeary systems of the universe is very scientific.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami described these universal affairs to Maharaja Pariksit as he had heard about them from his predecessor.</p>
<p>He explained these facts five thousand years ago, but the knowledge existed long, long before because Sukadeva Gosvami received it through disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Because this knowledge is accepted through the disciplic succession, it is perfect.</p>
<p>The history of modern scientific knowledge, on the contrary, does not go back more than a few hundred years.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if modern scientists do not accept the other factual presentations of Srimad-Bhagavatam, how can they deny the perfect astronomical calculations that existed long before they could imagine such things? There is so much information to gather from Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Modern scientists, however, have no information of other planeary systems and, indeed, are hardly conversant with the planet on which we are now living.</p>

<p>etavan—this much; loka-vinyasah—the placing of the different planes; mana—with measurements; laksana—symptoms; samsthabhih—as well as with their different situations; vicintitah—established by scientific calculations; kavibhih—by learned scholars; sah—that; tu—but; pancasat-koti—500,000,000 yojanas; ganitasya—which is measured at; bhu-golasya—of the planeary system known as Bhugolaka; turiya-bhagah—one fourth; ayam—this; lokaloka-acalah—the mountain known as Lokaloka.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Learned scholars who are free from mistakes, illusions and propensities to cheat have thus described the planeary systems and their particular symptoms, measurements and locations.</p>
<p>With great deliberation, they have established the truth that the distance between Sumeru and the mountain known as Lokaloka is one fourth of the diameter of the universe—or, in other words, 125,000,000 yojanas (1 billion miles).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has given accurate astronomical information about the location of Lokaloka Mountain, the movements of the sun globe and the distance between the sun and the circumference of the universe.</p>
<p>However, the technical terms used in the astronomical calculations given by the Jyotir Veda are difficult to translate into English.</p>

<p>On the top of Lokaloka Mountain are the four gaja-patis, the best of elephants, which were established in the four directions by Lord Brahma, the supreme spiritual master of the entire universe.</p>
<p>The names of those elephants are Rsabha, Puskaracuda, Vamana and Aparajita.</p>
<p>They are responsible for maintaining the planeary systems of the universe.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of all transcendental opulences and the master of the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>He is the Supreme Person, Bhagavan, the Supersoul of everyone.</p>
<p>The demigods, led by Indra, the King of heaven, are entrusted with seeing to the affairs of the material world.</p>
<p>To benefit all living beings in all the varied planes and to increase the power of those elephants and of the demigods, the Lord manifests Himself on top of that mountain in a spiritual body, uncontaminated by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Surrounded by His personal expansions and assistants like Visvaksena, He exhibits all His perfect opulences, such as religion and knowledge, and His mystic powers such as anima, laghima and mahima.</p>
<p>He is beautifully situated, and He is decorated by the different weapons in His four hands.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The various forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such as Narayana and Visnu, are beautifully decorated with different weapons.</p>
<p>The Lord exhibits those forms to maintain all the varied planes created by His personal potency, yogamaya.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.6) Lord Krsna says, sambhavamy atma-mayaya: I appear by My internal potency The word atma-maya refers to the Lord’s personal potency, yogamaya.</p>
<p>After creating both the material world and spiritual world through yogamaya, the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally maintains them by expanding Himself in different categories as the Visnu murtis and the demigods.</p>
<p>He maintains the material creation from beginning to end, and He personally maintains the spiritual world.</p>

<p>My dear King, outside Lokaloka Mountain is the tract of land known as Aloka-varsa, which extends for the same breadth as the area within the mountain—in other words, 125,000,000 yojanas (one billion miles).</p>
<p>Beyond Aloka-varsa is the destination of those who aspire for liberation from the material world.</p>
<p>It is beyond the jurisdiction of the material modes of nature, and therefore it is completely pure.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna took Arjuna through this place to bring back the sons of the brahmana.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sun is situated (vertically) in the middle of the universe, in the area between Bhurloka and Bhuvarloka, which is called antariksa, outer space.</p>
<p>The distance between the sun and the circumference of the universe is twenty-five koti yojanas (two billion miles).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word koti means ten million, and a yojana is eight miles.</p>
<p>The diameter of the universe is fifty koti yojanas (four billion miles).</p>
<p>Therefore, since the sun is in the middle of the universe, the distance between the sun and the edge of the universe is calculated to be twenty-five koti yojanas (two billion miles).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sun-god is also known as Vairaja, the total material body for all living entities.</p>
<p>Because he entered this dull egg of the universe at the time of creation, he is also called Martanda.</p>
<p>He is also known as Hiranyagarbha because he received his material body from Hiranyagarbha (Lord Brahma).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The post of Lord Brahma is meant for very highly elevated, spiritually advanced living beings.</p>
<p>When such living beings are unavailable, Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, expands Himself as Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>This takes place very rarely.</p>
<p>Consequently there are two kinds of Brahmas.</p>
<p>Sometimes Brahma is an ordinary living entity, and at other times Brahma is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Brahma spoken of here is an ordinary living being.</p>
<p>Whether Brahma is the Supreme Personality of Godhead or an ordinary living being, he is known as Vairaja Brahma and Hiranyagarbha Brahma.</p>
<p>Therefore the sun-god is also accepted as Vairaja Brahma.</p>

<p>O King, the sun-god and the sun plane divide all the directions of the universe.</p>
<p>It is only because of the presence of the sun that we can understand what the sky, the higher planes, this world and the lower planes are.</p>
<p>It is also only because of the sun that we can understand which places are for material enjoyment, which are for liberation, which are hellish and subterranean.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All living entities, including demigods, human beings, animals, birds, insects, reptiles, creepers and trees, depend upon the heat and light given by the sun-god from the sun plane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is because of the sun’s presence that all living entities can see, and therefore he is called drg-isvara, the Personality of Godhead presiding over sight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, surya atma atmatvenopasyah.</p>
<p>The actual life and soul of all living entities within this universe is the sun.</p>
<p>He is therefore upasya, worshipable.</p>
<p>We worship the sun-god by chanting the Gayatri mantra (om bhur bhuvah svah tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi).</p>
<p>Surya is the life and soul of this universe, and there are innumerable universes for which a sun-god is the life and soul, just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the life and soul of the entire creation.</p>
<p>We have information that Vairaja, Hiranyagarbha, entered the great, dull, material globe called the sun.</p>
<p>This indicates that the theory held by so-called scientists that no one lives there is wrong.Bhagavad-gita also says that Krsna first instructed Bhagavad-gita to the sun-god (imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam (Bg.4.1)).</p>
<p>Therefore the sun is not vacant.</p>
<p>It is inhabited by living entities, and the predominating deity is Vairaja, or Vivasvan.</p>
<p>The difference between the sun and earth is that the sun is a fiery plane, but everyone there has a suitable body and can live there without difficulty.</p>
