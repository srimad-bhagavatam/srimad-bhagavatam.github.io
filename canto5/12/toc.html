<p>svarupa-tucchikrta-vigrahaya</p>
<p>namo ’vadhuta dvija-bandhu-linga-</p>
<p>nigudha-nityanubhavaya tubhyam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>rahuganah uvaca—King Rahugana said; namah—my respectful obeisances; namah—obeisances; karana-vigrahaya—to one whose body emanates from the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes; svarupa-tucchikrta-vigrahaya—who has completely removed all the contradictions of the scriptures by manifesting his true self; namah—respectful obeisances; avadhuta—O master of all mystic power; dvija-bandhu-linga—by the characteristics of a person born in a brahmana family but not executing the duties of a brahmana; nigudha—covered; nitya-anubhavaya—to him whose eternal self-realization; tubhyam—to you.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Rahugana said: O most exalted personality, you are not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>By the influence of your true self, all kinds of contradiction in the sastras have been removed.</p>
<p>In the dress of a friend of a brahmana, you are hiding your transcendental blissful position.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the Brahma-samhita we understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes (sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>Rsabhadeva was the direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>His son, Bharata Maharaja, who was now acting as the brahmana Jada Bharata, had received his body from the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Therefore he is addressed as karana-vigrahaya.</p>
