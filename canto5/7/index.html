<h1>The Activities of King Bharata</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>5.7</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, the activities of King Bharata Maharaja, the emperor of the whole world, are described.</p>
<p>Bharata Maharaja performed various ritualistic ceremonies (Vedic yajnas) and satisfied the Supreme Lord by his different modes of worship.</p>
<p>In due course of time, he left home and resided in Hardwar and passed his days in devotional activities.</p>
<p>Being ordered by his father, Lord Rsabhadeva, Bharata Maharaja married Pancajani, the daughter of Visvarupa.</p>
<p>After this, he ruled the whole world peacefully.</p>
<p>Formerly this planet was known as Ajanabha, and after the reign of Bharata Maharaja it became known as Bharata-varsa.</p>
<p>Bharata Maharaja begot five sons in the womb of Pancajani, and he named the sons Sumati, Rastrabhrta, Sudarsana, Avarana and Dhumraketu.</p>
<p>Bharata Maharaja was very rigid in executing religious principles and following in the footsteps of his father.</p>
<p>He therefore ruled the citizens very successfully.</p>
<p>Because he performed various yajnas to satisfy the Supreme Lord, he was personally very satisfied.</p>
<p>Being of undisturbed mind, he increased his devotional activities unto Lord Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Bharata Maharaja was competent in understanding the principles of saintly persons like Narada, and he followed in the footsteps of the sages.</p>
<p>He also kept Lord Vasudeva constantly within his heart.</p>
<p>After finishing his kingly duties, he divided his kingdom among his five sons.</p>
<p>He then left home and went to the place of Pulaha known as Pulahasrama.</p>
<p>There he ate forest vegetables and fruits, and worshiped Lord Vasudeva with everything available.</p>
<p>Thus he increased his devotion toward Vasudeva, and he automatically began to realize further his transcendental, blissful life.</p>
<p>Due to his highly advanced spiritual position, there were sometimes visible in his body the asta-sattvika transformations, such as ecstatic crying and bodily trembling, which are symptoms of love of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is understood that Maharaja Bharata worshiped the Supreme Lord with the mantras mentioned in the Rg Veda, generally known as Gayatri mantra, which aim at the Supreme Narayana situated within the sun.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is most important that the chief executive rule the citizens by keeping them fully engaged in their respective occupational duties.</p>
<p>Some of the citizens were brahmanas, some were ksatriyas, and some were vaisyas and sudras.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the government to see that the citizens act according to these material divisions for their spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>No one should remain unemployed or unoccupied in any way.</p>
<p>One must work as a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra on the material path and on the spiritual path, everyone should act as a brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi.</p>

<p>Therefore society was very smoothly conducted.</p>



<p><strong>5.7.5</strong></p>
<p>ije ca bhagavantam yajna-kratu-rupam kratubhir uccavacaih sraddhayahrtagnihotra-darsa-purnamasa-caturmasya-pasu-somanam prakrti-vikrtibhir anusavanam caturhotra-vidhina.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>With great faith King Bharata performed various kinds of sacrifice.</p>
<p>He performed the sacrifices known as agni-hotra, darsa, purnamasa, caturmasya, pasu-yajna (wherein a horse is sacrificed) and soma-yajna (wherein a kind of beverage is offered).</p>
<p>Sometimes these sacrifices were performed completely and sometimes partially.</p>
<p>In any case, in all the sacrifices the regulations of caturhotra were strictly followed.</p>
<p>In this way Bharata Maharaja worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Animals like hogs and cows were offered in sacrifice to test the proper execution of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there was no purpose in killing the animal.</p>
<p>Actually the animal was offered in the sacrificial fire to get a rejuvenated life.</p>
<p>Generally an old animal was sacrificed in the fire and it would come out again in a youthful body.</p>
<p>Some of the rituals however, did not require animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the present age, animal sacrifices are forbidden.</p>
<p>As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu:</p>
<p>asvamedham gavalambham</p>
<p>sannyasam pala-paitrkam</p>
<p>devarena sutotpattim</p>
<p>kalau panca vivarjayet</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife (Cc.Adi17.164) Such sacrifices are impossible in this age due to the scarcity of expert brahmanas or rtvijah who are able to take the responsibility.</p>
<p>In the absence of these, the sankirtana-yajna is recommended.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag.11.5.32).</p>
<p>After all, sacrifices are executed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Yajnartha-karma: such activities should be carried out for the Supreme Lord’s pleasure.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, the Supreme Lord in His incarnation of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu should be worshiped with His associates by performance of sankirtana-yajna, the congregational chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>This process is accepted by intelligent men.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah.</p>
<p>The word sumedhasah refers to intelligent men who possess very good brain substance.</p>



<p><strong>5.7.6</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After performing the preliminaries of various sacrifices, Maharaja Bharata offered the results in the name of religion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva.</p>
<p>In other words, he performed all the yajnas for the satisfaction of Lord Vasudeva, Krsna.</p>
<p>Maharaja Bharata thought that since the demigods were different parts of Vasudeva’s body, He controls those who are explained in the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>By thinking in this way, Maharaja Bharata was freed from all material contamination, such as attachment, lust and greed.</p>
<p>When the priests were about to offer the sacrificial ingredients into the fire, Maharaja Bharata expertly understood how the offering made to different demigods was simply an offering to the different limbs of the Lord.</p>
<p>For instance, Indra is the arm of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Surya (the sun) is His eye.</p>
<p>Thus Maharaja Bharata considered that the oblations offered to different demigods were actually offered unto the different limbs of Lord Vasudeva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead says that as long as one does not develop the pure devotional service of sravanam kirtanam, hearing and chanting, one must carry out his prescribed duties.</p>
<p>Since Bharata Maharaja was a great devotee, one may ask why he performed so many sacrifices that are actually meant for karmis.</p>
<p>The fact is that he was simply following the orders of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita, sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me (Bg.18.66) Whatever we do, we should constantly remember Vasudeva.</p>
<p>People are generally addicted to offering obeisances to various demigods, but Bharata Maharaja simply wanted to please Lord Vasudeva.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita: bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram (Bg.5.29).</p>
<p>A yajna may be carried out to satisfy a particular demigod, but when the yajna is offered to the yajna-purusa, Narayana, the demigods are satisfied.</p>
<p>The purpose of performing different yajnas is to satisfy the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>One may perform them in the name of different demigods or directly.</p>
<p>If we directly offer oblations to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods are automatically satisfied.</p>
<p>If we water the root of a tree, the branches, twigs, fruits and flowers are automatically satisfied.</p>
<p>When one offers sacrifices to different demigods, one should remember that the demigods are simply parts of the body of the Supreme.</p>
<p>If we worship the hand of a person, we intend to satisfy the person himself.</p>
<p>If we massage a person’s legs, we do not really serve the legs but the person who possesses the legs.</p>
<p>All the demigods are different parts of the Lord, and if we offer service to them, we actually serve the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Demigod worship is mentioned in Brahma-samhita, but actually the slokas advocate worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.44):</p>
<p>srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka</p>
<p>chayeva yasya bhuvanani vibharti durga</p>
<p>icchanurupam api yasya ca cestate sa</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>Following the orders of Sri Krsna, the goddess Durga creates, maintains and annihilates.</p>
<p>Sri Krsna also confirms this statement in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings (Bg.9.10) We should worship the demigods in that spirit.</p>
<p>Because the goddess Durga satisfies Krsna, we should therefore offer respects to goddess Durga.</p>
<p>Because Lord Siva is nothing but Krsna’s functional body, we should therefore offer respects to Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Similarly, we should offer respects to Brahma, Agni and Surya.</p>
<p>There are many offerings to different demigods, and one should always remember that these offerings are usually meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Bharata Maharaja did not aspire to receive some benediction from demigods.</p>
<p>His aim was to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, among the thousand names of Visnu, it is said yajna-bhug yajna-krd yajnah.</p>
<p>The enjoyer of yajna, the performer of yajna and yajna itself are the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the performer of everything, but out of ignorance the living entity thinks that he is the actor.</p>
<p>As long as we think we are the actors, we bring about karma-bandha (bondage to activity).</p>
<p>If we act for yajna, for Krsna there is no karma-bandha.</p>
<p>Yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: (Bg.3.9)) Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed otherwise work binds one to this material world (Bg.3.9) Following the instructions of Bharata Maharaja, we should act not for our personal satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (17.28) it is also stated:</p>
<p>asraddhaya hutam dattam</p>
<p>tapas taptam krtam ca yat</p>
<p>asad ity ucyate partha</p>
<p>na ca tat pretya no iha</p>
<p>Sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead are nonpermanent.</p>
<p>Regardless of whatever rituals are performed, they are called asat, nonpermanent.</p>
<p>They are therefore useless both in this life and the next.</p>
<p>Kings like Maharaja Ambarisa and many other rajarsis who were pure devotees of the Lord simply passed their time in the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When a pure devotee executes some service through the agency of another person, he should not be criticized, for his activities are meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>A devotee may have a priest perform some karma-kanda, and the priest may not be a pure Vaisnava, but because the devotee wants to please the Supreme Lord, he should not be criticized.</p>
<p>The word apurva is very significant.</p>
<p>The resultant actions of karma are called apurva.</p>
<p>When we act piously or impiously, immediate results do not ensue.</p>
<p>We therefore wait for the results, which are called apurva.</p>
<p>The results are manifest in the future.</p>
<p>Even the smartas accept this apurva.</p>
<p>Pure devotees simply act for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the results of their activities are spiritual, or permanent.</p>
<p>They are not like those of the karmis, which are nonpermanent.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.23):</p>
<p>gata-sangasya muktasya</p>
<p>jnanavasthita-cetasah</p>
<p>yajnayacaratah karma</p>
<p>samagram praviliyate</p>
<p>The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence A devotee is always free from material contamination.</p>
<p>He is fully situated in knowledge, and therefore his sacrifices are intended for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>This is obtainable only when one is completely freed from the desire for material sense gratification and is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati (9.26).</p>
<p>Worship of the Lord is not at all expensive.</p>

<p>The Supreme Lord accepts these offerings when they are offered with love and devotion.</p>
<p>In this way, one can become freed from material desires.</p>

<p>The supreme occupation (dharma) for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord.</p>
<p>Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self.</p>
<p>By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world (Bhag.1.2.6–7) These are the instructions given in Srimad-Bhagavatam, the supreme Vedic literature.</p>
<p>One may not be able to go to Pulaha-asrama, but wherever one is one can happily render devotional service to the Lord by adopting the processes mentioned above.</p>

<p>The predominating Deity of the sun is another expansion of Narayana, who is illuminating the entire universe.</p>

<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah I am sitting in everyone’s heart (Bg.15.15) As the Supersoul, the Lord enters the hearts of all living entities.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.35), andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: He enters the universe and the atom as well In the Rg Veda, the predominating Deity of the sun is worshiped by, this mantra: dhyeyah sada savitr-mandala-madhya-varti narayanah sarasijasana-sannivistah.</p>

<p>We also have information that the moonshine helps vegetables and herbs grow.</p>
<p>Actually Narayana within the sun is maintaining the entire universe; therefore Narayana should be worshiped by the Gayatri mantra or the Rg mantra.</p>
