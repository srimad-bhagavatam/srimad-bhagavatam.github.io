<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#519" id="519">5.19</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the glories of Bharata-varsa, and it also describes how Lord Ramacandra is being worshiped in the tract of land known as Kimpurusa-varsa.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Kimpurusa-varsa are fortunate because they worship Lord Ramacandra with His faithful servant Hanuman.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra exemplifies an incarnation of Godhead who descends for the mission of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)—protecting the devotees and destroying the miscreants.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra exhibits the actual purpose of an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the devotees take the opportunity to offer loving transcendental service to Him.</p>
<p>One should surrender fully to the Lord, forgetting one’s so-called material happiness, opulence and education, which are not at all useful for pleasing the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is pleased only by the process of surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>When Devarsi Narada descended to instruct Sarvani Manu, he described the opulence of Bharata-varsa, India.</p>
<p>Sarvani Manu and the inhabitants of Bharata-varsa engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of creation, maintenance and annihilation and who is always worshiped by self-realized souls.</p>
<p>In the planet known as Bharata-varsa there are many rivers and mountains, as there are in other tracts of land, yet Bharata-varsa has special significance because in this tract of land there exists the Vedic principle of varnasrama-dharma, which divides society into four varnas and four asramas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Narada Muni’s opinion is that even if there is some temporary disturbance in the execution of the varnasrama-dharma principles, they can be revived at any moment.</p>
<p>The effect of adhering to the institution of varnasrama is gradual elevation to the spiritual platform and liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>By following the principles of varnasrama-dharma, one gets the opportunity to associate with devotees.</p>
<p>Such association gradually awakens one’s dormant propensity to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and frees one from all the basic principles of sinful life.</p>
<p>One then gets the opportunity to offer unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Because of this opportunity, the inhabitants of Bharata-varsa are praised even in the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Even in the topmost planet of this universe, Brahmaloka, the position of Bharata-varsa is discussed with great relish.</p>
<p>All the conditioned living entities are evolving within the universe in different planets and different species of life.</p>
<p>Thus one may be elevated to Brahmaloka, but then one must again descend to earth, as confirmed in Srimad Bhagavad-gita (abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino ’rjuna (Bg.8.16)).</p>
<p>If those who live in Bharata-varsa rigidly follow the principles of varnasrama-dharma and develop their dormant Krsna consciousness, they need not return to this material world after death.</p>
<p>Any place where one cannot hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from realized souls, even if it be Brahmaloka, is not very congenial to the living entity.</p>
<p>If one who has taken birth in the land of Bharata-varsa as a human being does not take advantage of the opportunity for spiritual elevation, his position is certainly the most miserable.</p>
<p>In the land known as Bharatavarsa, even if one is a sarva-kama-bhakta, a devotee seeking the fulfillment of some material desire, he is freed from all material desires by his association with devotees, and ultimately he becomes a pure devotee and returns home, back to Godhead, without difficulty.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, Sri Sukadeva Gosvami describes to Maharaja Pariksit the eight sub-islands within the island of Jambudvipa.</p>
