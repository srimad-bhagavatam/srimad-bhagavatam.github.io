<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#511" id="511">5.11</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the brahmana Jada Bharata instructs Maharaja Rahugana in detail.</p>
<p>He tells the King: You are not very experienced, yet you pose yourself as a learned person because you are very proud of your knowledge.</p>
<p>Actually a person who is on the transcendental platform does not care for social behavior that sacrifices spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Social behavior comes within the jurisdiction of karma-kanda, material benefit.</p>
<p>No one can spiritually advance by such activities.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul is always overpowered by the modes of material nature and consequently he is simply concerned with material benefits and auspicious and inauspicious material things.</p>
<p>In other words, the mind, which is the leader of the senses, is absorbed in material activities life after life.</p>
<p>Thus he continuously gets different types of bodies and suffers miserable material conditions.</p>
<p>On the basis of mental concoction, social behavior has been formulated.</p>
<p>If one’s mind is absorbed in these activities, he certainly remains conditioned within the material world.</p>
<p>According to different opinions, there are eleven or twelve mental activities, which can be transformed into hundreds and thousands.</p>
<p>A person who is not Krsna conscious is subjected to all these mental concoctions and is thus governed by the material energy.</p>
<p>The living entity who is free from mental concoctions attains the platform of pure spirit soul, devoid of material contamination.</p>
<p>There are two types of living entities—jivatma and Paramatma, the individual soul and the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>That Supreme Soul in His ultimate realization is Lord Vasudeva, Krsna.</p>
<p>He enters into everyone’s heart and controls the living entity in his different activities.</p>
<p>He is therefore the supreme shelter of all living entities.</p>
<p>One can understand the Supreme Soul and one’s position in relationship with Him when one is completely freed from the unwanted association of ordinary men.</p>
<p>In this way one can become fit to cross the ocean of nescience.</p>
<p>The cause of conditional Life is attachment to the external energy.</p>
<p>One has to conquer these mental concoctions: unless one does so, he will never be freed from material anxieties.</p>
<p>Although mental concoctions have no value, their influence is still very formidable.</p>
<p>No one should neglect to control the mind.</p>
<p>If one does, the mind becomes so powerful that one immediately forgets his real position.</p>
<p>Forgetting that he is an eternal servant of Krsna and that service to Krsna is his only business, one is doomed by material nature to serve the objects of the senses.</p>
<p>One should kill mental concoctions by the sword of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee (guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija</p>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#5111" id="5111">5.11.1</a></strong></p>
<p>brahmana uvaca</p>
<p>akovidah kovida-vada-vadan</p>
<p>vadasy atho nati-vidam varisthah</p>
<p>na surayo hi vyavaharam enam</p>
<p>tattvavamarsena sahamananti</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>brahmanah uvaca—the brahmana said; akovidah—without having experience; kovida-vada-vadan—words used by experienced persons; vadasi—you are speaking; atho—therefore; na—not; ati-vidam—of those who are very experienced; varisthah—the most important; na—not; surayah—such intelligent persons; hi—indeed; vyavaharam—mundane and social behavior; enam—this; tattva—of the truth; avamarsena—fine judgment by intelligence; saha—with; amananti—discuss.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The brahmana Jada Bharata said: My dear King, although you are not at all experienced, you are trying to speak like a very experienced man.</p>
<p>Consequently you cannot be considered an experienced person.</p>
<p>An experienced person does not speak the way you are speaking about the relationship between a master and a servant or about material pains and pleasures.</p>
<p>These are simply external activities.</p>
<p>Any advanced, experienced man, considering the Absolute Truth, does not talk in this way.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna similarly chastised Arjuna.</p>
<p>Asocyan anvasocas tvam prajna-vadams ca bhasase: While speaking learned words, you are lamenting for what is not worthy of grief (Bg.2.11) Similarly, among people in general, 99.9 percent try to talk like experienced advisers, but they are actually devoid of spiritual knowledge and are therefore like inexperienced children speaking nonsensically.</p>
<p>Consequently their words cannot be given any importance.</p>
<p>One has to learn from Krsna or His devotee.</p>
<p>If one speaks on the basis of this experience—that is, on the basis of spiritual knowledge—one’s words are valuable.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the entire world is full of foolish people.Bhagavad-gita describes these people as mudhas.</p>
<p>They are trying to rule human society, but because they are devoid of spiritual knowledge, the entire world is in a chaotic condition.</p>
<p>To be released from these miserable conditions, one has to become Krsna conscious and take lessons from an exalted personality like Jada Bharata, Lord Krsna and Kapiladeva.</p>
<p>That is the only way to solve the problems of material life.</p>
