<h1><a class="header" href="#the-dynasty-of-bharata" id="the-dynasty-of-bharata">The Dynasty of Bharata</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#921" id="921">9.21</a></strong></p>
<p>This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Maharaja Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dusmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamidha and others.</p>
<p>The son of Bharadvaja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were Brhatksatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara and Garga.</p>
<p>Of these five, Nara had a son named Sankrti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva.</p>
<p>As an exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast.</p>
<p>Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a brahmana guest appeared.</p>
<p>Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the brahmana.</p>
<p>When the brahmana left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a sudra appeared.</p>
<p>Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the sudra and himself.</p>
<p>Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared.</p>
<p>Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the water.</p>
<p>This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service.</p>
<p>The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.</p>
<p>Garga, the son of Bharadvaja, had a son named Sini, and Sini’s son was Gargya.</p>
<p>Although Gargya was a ksatriya by birth, his sons became brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Mahavirya was Duritaksaya, whose sons were of a ksatriya king, they also achieved the position of brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Brhatksatra constructed the city of Hastinapura and was known as Hasti.</p>
<p>His sons were Ajamidha, Dvimidha and Purumidha.</p>
<p>From Ajamidha came Priyamedha and other brahmanas and also a son named Brhadisu.</p>
<p>The sons, grandsons and further descendants of Brhadisu were Brhaddhanu, Brhatkaya, Jayadratha, Visada and Syenajit.</p>
<p>From Syenajit came four sons—Rucirasva, Drdhahanu, Kasya and Vatsa.</p>
<p>From Rucirasva came a son named Para, whose sons were Prthusena and Nipa, and from Nipa came one hundred sons.</p>
<p>Another son of Nipa was Brahmadatta.</p>
<p>From Brahmadatta came Visvaksena; from Visvaksena, Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhallata.</p>
<p>The son of Dvimidha was Yavinara, and from Yavinara came many sons and grandsons, such as Krtiman, Satyadhrti, Drdhanemi, Suparsva, Sumati, Sannatiman, Krti, Nipa, Udgrayudha, Ksemya, Suvira, Ripunjaya and Bahuratha.</p>
<p>Purumidha had no sons, but Ajamidha, in addition to his other sons, had a son named Nila, whose son was Santi.</p>
<p>The descendants of Santi were Susanti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyasva.</p>
<p>Bharmyasva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of brahmanas.</p>
<p>Mudgala had twins—a son, Divodasa, and a daughter, Ahalya.</p>
<p>From Ahalya, by her husband, Gautama, Satananda was born.</p>
<p>The son of Satananda was Satyadhrti, and his son was Saradvan.</p>
<p>Saradvan’s son was known as Krpa, and Saradvan’s daughter, known as Krpi, became the wife of Dronacarya.</p>
