<p>Vidarbha had three sons, named Kusa, Kratha and Romapada.</p>
<p>Of these three, Romapada expanded his dynasty by the sons and grandsons named Babhru, Krti, Usika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became kings.</p>

<p>Another son of Satvata was Mahabhoja, by whom the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated.</p>
<p>Another was Vrsni, who had a son named Yudhajit.</p>
<p>From Yudhajit came Anamitra and Sini, and from Anamitra came Nighna and another Sini.</p>

<p>The four sons of Devaka were known as Devavan, Upadeva, Sudeva and Devavardhana, and his seven daughters were Dhrtadeva, Santideva, Upadeva, Srideva, Devaraksita, Sahadeva and Devaki.</p>

<p>Viduratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Sura, who had ten other sons, of whom Vasudeva was the chief.</p>
<p>Sura gave one of his five daughters, Prtha, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named Kunti.</p>
<p>In her maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karna, and later she married Maharaja Pandu.</p>
<p>Vrddhasarma married the daughter of Sura named Srutadeva, from whose womb Dantavakra was born.</p>

<p>Devabhaga, through the womb of Kamsa, begot Citraketu and Brhadbala; and Devasrava, through the womb of Kamsavati, begot Suvira and Isuman.</p>
<p>From Kanka, through the womb of Kanka, came Baka, Satyajit and Purujit, and from Srnjaya, through the womb of Rastrapalika, came Vrsa and Durmarsana.</p>
<p>Syamaka, through the womb of Surabhumi, begot Harikesa and Hiranyaksa.</p>
<p>Vatsaka, through the womb of Misrakesi, begot Vrka, who begot the sons named Taksa, Puskara and Sala.</p>
<p>From Samika came Sumitra and Arjunapala, and from Anaka came Rtadhama and Jaya.</p>
<p>Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devaki and Rohini were the most important.</p>
<p>From the womb of Rohini, Baladeva was born, along with Gada, Sarana, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Krta and others.</p>
<p>Vasudeva had many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devaki was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from the burden of demons.</p>
<p>This chapter ends by glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva.</p>
