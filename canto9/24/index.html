<h1>Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.24</strong></p>
<p>Vidarbha had three sons, named Kusa, Kratha and Romapada.</p>
<p>Of these three, Romapada expanded his dynasty by the sons and grandsons named Babhru, Krti, Usika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became kings.</p>
<p>From the son of Vidarbha named Kratha came a son named Kunti, from whose dynasty came the descendants named Vrsni, Nirvrti, Dasarha, Vyoma, Jimuta, Vikrti, Bhimaratha, Navaratha, Dasaratha, Sakuni, Karambhi, Devarata, Devaksatra, Madhu, Kuruvasa, Anu, Puruhotra, Ayu and Satvata.</p>
<p>Satvata had seven sons.</p>
<p>One of them was Devavrdha, whose son was Babhru.</p>
<p>Another son of Satvata was Mahabhoja, by whom the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated.</p>
<p>Another was Vrsni, who had a son named Yudhajit.</p>
<p>From Yudhajit came Anamitra and Sini, and from Anamitra came Nighna and another Sini.</p>

<p>The younger brothers of Vasudeva married all the daughters of Ugrasena.</p>
<p>Viduratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Sura, who had ten other sons, of whom Vasudeva was the chief.</p>
<p>Sura gave one of his five daughters, Prtha, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named Kunti.</p>
<p>In her maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karna, and later she married Maharaja Pandu.</p>
<p>Vrddhasarma married the daughter of Sura named Srutadeva, from whose womb Dantavakra was born.</p>
<p>Dhrstaketu married Sura’s daughter named Srutakirti, who had five sons.</p>
<p>Jayasena married Sura’s daughter named Rajadhidevi.</p>

<p>Devabhaga, through the womb of Kamsa, begot Citraketu and Brhadbala; and Devasrava, through the womb of Kamsavati, begot Suvira and Isuman.</p>
<p>From Kanka, through the womb of Kanka, came Baka, Satyajit and Purujit, and from Srnjaya, through the womb of Rastrapalika, came Vrsa and Durmarsana.</p>
<p>Syamaka, through the womb of Surabhumi, begot Harikesa and Hiranyaksa.</p>
<p>Vatsaka, through the womb of Misrakesi, begot Vrka, who begot the sons named Taksa, Puskara and Sala.</p>
<p>From Samika came Sumitra and Arjunapala, and from Anaka came Rtadhama and Jaya.</p>
<p>Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devaki and Rohini were the most important.</p>
<p>From the womb of Rohini, Baladeva was born, along with Gada, Sarana, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Krta and others.</p>
<p>Vasudeva had many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devaki was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from the burden of demons.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Through Marisa, King Sura begot Vasudeva, Devabhaga, Devasrava, Anaka, Srnjaya, Syamaka, Kanka, Samika, Vatsaka and Vrka.</p>
<p>These ten sons were spotlessly pious personalities.</p>
<p>When Vasudeva was born, the demigods from the heavenly kingdom sounded kettledrums.</p>
<p>Therefore Vasudeva, who provided the proper place for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, was also known as Anakadundubhi.</p>
<p>The five daughters of King Sura, named Prtha, Srutadeva, Srutakirti, Srutasrava and Rajadhidevi, were Vasudeva’s sisters.</p>
<p>Sura gave Prtha to his friend Kunti, who had no issue, and therefore another name of Prtha was Kunti.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Vedic civilization, if a girl gives birth to a child before she is married, no one will marry her.</p>
<p>Therefore although the sun-god, after appearing before Prtha, wanted to give her a child, Prtha hesitated because she was still unmarried.</p>

<p>The custom is that a girl should be married aksata-yoni, that is, with her virginity undisturbed.</p>
<p>A girl should never bear a child before her marriage.</p>

<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself In the present age, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to inaugurate the Hare Krsna movement.</p>
<p>At the present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and bad (manda).</p>
<p>They have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the benefits of the human form to live like cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has inaugurated the Hare Krsna movement, which is not different from Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If one associates with this movement, he directly associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>People should take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra and thus gain relief from all the problems created in this age of Kali.</p>

<p>na hy asya janmano hetuh</p>
<p>karmano va mahipate</p>
<p>atma-mayam vinesasya</p>
<p>parasya drastur atmanah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; hi—indeed; asya—of Him (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); janmanah—of the appearance, or taking birth; hetuh—there is any cause; karmanah—or for acting; va—either; mahipate—O King (Maharaja Pariksit); atma-mayam—His supreme compassion for the fallen souls; vina—without; isasya—of the supreme controller; parasya—of the Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the material world; drastuh—of the Supersoul, who witnesses everyone’s activities; atmanah—of the Supersoul of everyone.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, Maharaja Pariksit, but for the Lord’s personal desire, there is no cause for His appearance, disappearance or activities.</p>
<p>As the Supersoul, He knows everything.</p>
<p>Consequently there is no cause that affects Him, not even the results of fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being.</p>
<p>An ordinary living being receives a particular type of body according to his past activities (karmana daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye (SB 3.31.1)).</p>
<p>A living being is never independent and can never appear independently.</p>
<p>Rather, one is forced to accept a body imposed upon him by maya according to his past karma.</p>
<p>As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), yantrarudhani mayaya.</p>
<p>The body is a kind of machine created and offered to the living entity by the material energy under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the living entity must accept a particular type of body awarded to him by maya, the material energy, according to his karma.</p>
<p>One cannot independently say, Give me a body like thi or Give me a body like that One must accept whatever body is offered by the material energy.</p>
<p>This is the position of the ordinary living being.</p>
<p>When Krsna descends, however, He does so out of His merciful compassion for the fallen souls.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):</p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam</p>
<p>vinasaya ca duskrtam</p>
<p>dharma-samsthapanarthaya</p>
<p>sambhavami yuge yuge</p>
<p>To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium The Supreme Lord is not forced to appear.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one can subject Him to force, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Everyone is under His control, and He is not under the control of anyone else.</p>
<p>Foolish people who because of a poor fund of knowledge think that one can equal Krsna or become Krsna are condemned in every way.</p>
<p>No one can equal or surpass Krsna, who is therefore described as asamaurdhva.</p>
<p>According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the word maya is used in the sense of false prid and also in the sense of compassion For an ordinary living being, the body in which he appears is his punishment.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14), daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome But when Krsna comes the word maya refers to His compassion or mercy upon the devotees and fallen souls.</p>
<p>By His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone, whether sinful or pious.</p>



<p><strong>9.24.58</strong></p>
<p>yan maya-cestitam pumsah</p>
<p>sthity-utpatty-apyayaya hi</p>
<p>anugrahas tan-nivrtter</p>
<p>atma-labhaya cesyate</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat—whatever; maya-cestitam—the laws of material nature enacted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; pumsah—of the living entities; sthiti—duration of life; utpatti—birth; apyayaya—annihilation; hi—indeed; anugrahah—compassion; tat-nivrtteh—the creation and manifestation of cosmic energy to stop the repetition of birth and death; atma-labhaya—thus going home, back to Godhead; ca—indeed; isyate—for this purpose the creation is there.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His material energy in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation just to deliver the living entity by His compassion and stop the living entity’s birth, death and duration of materialistic life.</p>
<p>Thus He enables the living being to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material world for the suffering of the living entities.</p>
<p>The material creation is certainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):</p>
<p>mamaivamso jiva-loke</p>
<p>jiva-bhutah sanatanah</p>
<p>manah sasthanindriyani</p>
<p>prakrti-sthani karsati</p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.</p>
<p>Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind All the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure potency.</p>
<p>Anandamayo ’bhyasat (Vedanta-sutra1.1.12).</p>
<p>Both the Lord and the living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without Krsna, he is put into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahma and is gradually degraded to the status of an ant or a worm in stool.</p>
<p>This is called manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati (Bg.15.7).</p>
<p>There is a great struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature’s full control (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world.</p>
<p>Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati (Bg.15.7).</p>
<p>He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues.</p>
<p>Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adhah (Bhag.10.2.32).</p>
<p>Even having attained that param padam, having merged into the impersonal Brahman, he falls again to the material world.</p>
<p>In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for existence in this material world, and therefore the Lord, out of compassion for him, appears in this world and instructs him.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):</p>
<p>yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>
<p>tadatmanam srjamy aham</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself The real dharma is to surrender unto Krsna, but the rebellious living entity, instead of surrendering to Krsna, engages in adharma, in a struggle for existence to become like Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore out of compassion Krsna creates this material world to give the living entity a chance to understand his real position.Bhagavad-gita and similar Vedic literatures are presented so that the living being may understand his relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15).</p>
<p>All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is called brahma-jijnasa.</p>
<p>Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the best chance for him to understand his position.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse says, anugrahas tan-nivrtteh, indicating that the false life of repeated birth and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the creation.</p>
<p>The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think asatyam apratistham te</p>
<p>jagad ahur anisvaram</p>
<p>aparaspara-sambhutam</p>
<p>kim anyat kama-haitukam</p>
<p>They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control.</p>
<p>It is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust (Bg.16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no God and that the creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman meet by chance and the woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child.</p>
<p>Actually, however, this is not the fact.</p>
<p>The fact is that there is a purpose for this creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return to his original consciousness, Krsna consciousness, and then return home, back to Godhead, and be completely happy in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>In the material world the conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his senses, but at the same time he is informed by Vedic knowledge that this material world is not his actual place for happiness.</p>
<p>Janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam (Bg.13.9).</p>
<p>One must stop the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Every human being, therefore, should take advantage of this creation by understanding Krsna and his relationship with Krsna and in this way return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>aksauhininam patibhir</p>
<p>asurair nrpa-lanchanaih</p>
<p>bhuva akramyamanaya</p>
<p>abharaya krtodyamah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aksauhininam—of kings possessing great military power; patibhih—by such kings or government; asuraih—actually demons (because they do not need such military power but create it unnecessarily); nrpa-lanchanaih—who are actually unfit to be kings (although they have somehow taken possession of the government); bhuvah—on the surface of the earth; akramyamanayah—aiming at attacking one another; abharaya—paving the way for diminishing the number of demons on the surface of the earth; krta-udyamah—enthusiastic (they spend all the revenue of the state to increase military power).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they do not know the duty of the government.</p>
<p>Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the surface of the earth is reduced.</p>
<p>The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam.</p>
<p>The sadhus, the devotees of the Lord, are always eager to advance the cause of Krsna consciousness so that the conditioned souls may be released from the bondage of birth and death.</p>
<p>But the asuras, the demons, impede the advancement of the Krsna consciousness movement, and therefore Krsna arranges occasional fights between different asuras who are very much interested in increasing their military power.</p>
<p>The duty of the government or king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the government is to see that the people of the state advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide brahmanas, and they should be given all protection.</p>
<p>Namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca.</p>
<p>Krsna is very fond of brahmanas and cows, The brahmanas promulgate the cause of advancement in Krsna consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>The ksatriyas and the government should be advised by the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Next, the vaisyas should produce enough foodstuffs, and the sudras, who cannot do anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas).</p>
<p>This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of Krsna’s descent on the surface of the earth (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)).</p>
<p>Everyone must understand Krsna’s activities (janma karma ca me divyam (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>If one understands the purpose of Krsna’s coming to this earth and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated.</p>
<p>This liberation is the purpose of the creation and Krsna’s descent upon the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Demons are very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but Krsna’s devotees want to teach Krsna consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and Krsna conscious advancement.</p>
<p>Although demons have created many plans for industry and hard labor so that people will work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization.</p>
<p>Such endeavors are jagato’hitah; that is, they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general.</p>
<p>Ksayaya: such activities lead to annihilation.</p>
<p>One who understands the purpose of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, should seriously understand the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement and seriously take part in it.</p>
<p>One should not endeavor for ugra-karma, or unnecessary work for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti (Bhag.5.5.4).</p>
<p>Simply for sense gratification, people make plans for material happiness.</p>
<p>Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan (Bhag.7.9.43).</p>
<p>They do this because they are all vimudhas, rascals.</p>
<p>For flickering happiness, people waste their human energy, not understanding the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement but instead accusing the simple devotees of brainwashing.</p>
<p>Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Krsna consciousness movement, but Krsna will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kalau—in this age of Kali; janisyamananam—of the conditioned souls who will take birth in the future; duhkha-soka-tamah-nudam—to minimize their unlimited unhappiness and lamentation, which are caused by ignorance; anugrahaya—just to show mercy; bhaktanam—to the devotees; su-punyam—very pious, transcendental activities; vyatanot—expanded; yasah—His glories or reputation.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth in the future in this age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, acted in such a way that simply by remembering Him one will be freed from all the lamentation and unhappiness of material existence (In other words, He acted so that all future devotees, by accepting the instructions of Krsna consciousness stated in Bhagavad-gita, could be relieved from the pangs of material existence.)</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord’s activities of saving the devotees and killing the demons (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)) take place side by side.</p>
<p>Krsna actually appears for the deliverance of the sadhus, or bhaktas, but by killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by Krsna is liberated.</p>
<p>Whether the Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind to both the demons and the devotees.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yasmin—in the history of the transcendental activities of Krsna upon the surface of the earth; sat-karna-piyuse—who pleases the demands of the transcendental, purified ears; yasah-tirtha-vare—keeping oneself in the best of holy places by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord; sakrt—once only, immediately; srotra-anjalih—in the form of hearing the transcendental message; upasprsya—touching (exactly like the water of the Ganges); dhunute—destroys; karma-vasanam—the strong desire for fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental ears, the devotees of the Lord are immediately freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as enacted in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they are no longer interested in materialistic activities.</p>
<p>Thus they achieve freedom from the material world.</p>
<p>For sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process of janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi—birth, death, old age and disease—but the devotee, simply by hearing the message of Bhagavad-gita and further relishing the narrations of Srimad-Bhagavatam, becomes so pure that he no longer takes interest in materialistic activities.</p>
<p>At the moment, devotees in the Western countries are being attracted by Krsna consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities, and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement.</p>
<p>But they cannot possibly check this movement or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions.</p>
<p>Here the words srotranjalir upasprsya indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord the devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11) Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the devotees are freed from such activities.</p>
<p>The devotees are situated in liberation (brahma-bhuyaya kalpate), and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Vrsni, Andhaka, Madhu, Surasena, Dasarha, Kuru, Srnjaya and Pandu, Lord Krsna performed various activities.</p>
<p>By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate behavior, His instructions and His uncommon pastimes like raising Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His transcendental body, pleased all of human society.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The words nrlokam ramayam asa murtya sarvanga-ramyaya are significant.</p>
<p>Krsna is the original form.Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word murtya.</p>
<p>The word murti means form Krsna, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a manifestation of His transcendental body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti (Bs.5.40)).</p>
<p>The Lord is narakrti, exactly resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from ours.</p>
<p>Therefore the word sarvanga-ramyaya informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Apart from His smiling face, every part of His body—His hands, His legs, His chest—is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any time stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord.</p>

<p>His ears are beautiful, His cheeks brilliant, and His smiling attractive to everyone.</p>
<p>Whoever sees Lord Krsna sees a festival.</p>
<p>His face and body are fully satisfying for everyone to see, but the devotees are angry at the creator for the disturbance caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita (7.3):</p>
<p>manusyanam sahasresu</p>
<p>kascid yatati siddhaye</p>
<p>yatatam api siddhanam</p>
<p>kascin mam vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth Unless one is qualified to understand Krsna, one cannot appreciate the presence of Krsna on earth.</p>
<p>Among the Bhojas, Vrsnis, Andhakas, Pandavas and many other kings intimately related with Krsna, the intimate relationship between Krsna and the inhabitants of Vrndavana is especially to be noted.</p>
<p>That relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsavam na tatrpur drsibhih pibantyah.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Vrndavana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the cows, the calves, the gopis and Krsna’s father and mother, were never fully satisfied, although they saw Krsna’s beautiful features constantly.</p>
<p>Seeing Krsna is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Vrndavana saw Krsna almost every moment, but when Krsna left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the gopis were very much afflicted because they saw Krsna walking on the sand and thought that Krsna’s lotus feet, which they dared not place on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone.</p>
<p>By even thinking of this, the gopis were affected, and they cried at home.</p>
<p>These gopis, who were therefore the exalted friends of Krsna, saw Krsna constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of Krsna, the gopis condemned the creator, Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Therefore the beauty of Krsna, especially the beauty of His face, is described here.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of Krsna’s beauty.</p>
<p>Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Krsna’s head.</p>
<p>The entire Srimad-Bhagavata Purana is the embodiment of Krsna’s form, and the Tenth Canto is His face.</p>
<p>This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is.</p>
<p>Krsna’s smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts—all this was minutely observed by the gopis, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Krsna’s face, but instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision.</p>
<p>The beauty of Krsna’s face was therefore much more appreciated by the gopis than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Yasoda Mata, who was also interested in decorating the face of Krsna.</p>

<p>In Vrndavana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dvaraka, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: by all the Vedas, it is Krsna who is to be known.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic ceremonies described in the Vedas and established the principles of grhastha life by marrying many wives and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic principles.</p>
<p>The center of Vedic sacrifice is Krsna (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>To advance in human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Krsna in His householder life.</p>
<p>The real purpose of Krsna’s appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possible only in Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord immediately left for Vrndavana.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the gopis and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons.</p>
<p>This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be purusam sasvatam divyam—the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Here also we find the words utpadya tesu purusah.</p>
<p>Therefore it is to be concluded that the Absolute Truth is purusa, a person.</p>
<p>The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal.</p>
<p>And not only is He purusa, a person, but He is the lila-purusottama, the best of all persons.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Lord Sri Krsna created a misunderstanding between family members just to diminish the burden of the world.</p>
<p>Simply by His glance, He annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra and declared victory for Arjuna.</p>
<p>Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)</p>
<p>The mission of Lord Krsna was performed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, for by the Lord’s mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the others were killed simply by the Lord’s glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities and enabled them to attain sarupya.</p>
<p>Finally, Lord Krsna instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of devotional service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode.</p>
<p>The Lord’s instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gita are full of jnana and vairagya, knowledge and renunciation.</p>
<p>In the human form of life, one must learn these two things—how to become detached from the material world and how to acquire full knowledge in spiritual life.</p>
<p>This is the Lord’s mission (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)).</p>
<p>After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>END OF THE NINTH CANTO</p>
