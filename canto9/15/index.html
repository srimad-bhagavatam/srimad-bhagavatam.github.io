<h1>Parasurama, the Lord’s Warrior Incarnation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.15</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Gadhi in the dynasty of Aila.</p>
<p>From the womb of Urvasi came six sons, named Ayu, Srutayu, Satyayu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya.</p>
<p>The son of Srutayu was Vasuman, the son of Satyayu was Srutanjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhima.</p>
<p>Bhima’s son was named Kancana, the son of Kancana was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the Ganges in one sip.</p>
<p>The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Balaka, Ajaka and Kusa.</p>
<p>The sons of Kusa were Kusambu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kusanabha.</p>
<p>From Kusambu came Gadhi, who had a daughter named Satyavati.</p>
<p>Satyavati married Rcika Muni after the muni contributed a substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavati by Rcika Muni, Jamadagni was born.</p>
<p>The son of Jamadagni was Rama, or Parasurama.</p>
<p>When a king named Kartaviryarjuna stole Jamadagni’s desire cow, Parasurama, who is ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kartaviryarjuna.</p>
<p>Later, he annihilated the ksatriya dynasty twenty-one times.</p>
<p>After Parasurama killed Kartaviryarjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a brahmana he should have tolerated the offense.</p>
<p>Therefore Jamadagni advised Parasurama to atone for his sin by traveling to various holy places.</p>

<p>King Gadhi had a daughter named Satyavati, whom a brahmana sage named Rcika requested from the King to be his wife.</p>
<p>King Gadhi, however, regarded Rcika as an unfit husband for his daughter, and therefore he told the brahmana, My dear sir, I belong to the dynasty of Kusa.</p>
<p>Because we are aristocratic ksatriyas, you have to give some dowry for my daughter.</p>
<p>Therefore, bring at least one thousand horses, each as brilliant as moonshine and each having one black ear, whether right or left</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The son of King Gadhi was Visvamitra, who was said to be a brahmana and ksatriya combined.</p>
<p>Visvamitra attained the status of a brahmarsi, as explained later.</p>
<p>From the marriage of Satyavati with Rcika Muni would come a son with the spirit of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>King Gadhi demanded that an uncommon request be fulfilled before the brahmana Rcika could marry his daughter.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.7</strong></p>
<p>ity uktas tan-matam jnatva</p>

<p>Therefore he went to the demigod Varuna and brought from him the one thousand horses that Gadhi had demanded.</p>
<p>After delivering these horses, the sage married the King’s beautiful daughter.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.8</strong></p>
<p>sa rsih prarthitah patnya</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Rcika Muni’s wife and mother-in-law, each desiring a son, requested the Muni to prepare an oblation.</p>
<p>Thus Rcika Muni prepared one oblation for his wife with a brahmana mantra and another for his mother-in-law with a ksatriya mantra.</p>
<p>Then he went out to bathe.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.9</strong></p>
<p>tavat satyavati matra</p>
<p>sva-carum yacita sati</p>
<p>srestham matva tayayacchan</p>
<p>matre matur adat svayam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, because Satyavati’s mother thought that the oblation prepared for her daughter, Rcika’s wife, must be better, she asked her daughter for that oblation.</p>
<p>Satyavati therefore gave her own oblation to her mother and ate her mother’s oblation herself.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A husband naturally has some affection for his wife.</p>
<p>Therefore Satyavati’s mother thought that the oblation prepared for Satyavati by the sage Rcika must have been better than her own oblation.</p>
<p>In Rcika’s absence, the mother took the better oblation from Satyavati and ate it.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.10</strong></p>
<p>tad viditva munih praha</p>
<p>patnim kastam akarasih</p>
<p>ghoro danda-dharah putro</p>
<p>bhrata te brahma-vittamah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—this fact; viditva—having learned; munih—the great sage; praha—said; patnim—unto his wife; kastam—very regrettable; akarasih—you have done; ghorah—fierce; danda-dharah—a great personality who can punish others; putrah—such a son; bhrata—brother; te—your; brahma-vittamah—a learned scholar in spiritual science.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the great sage Rcika returned home after bathing and understood what had happened in his absence, he said to his wife, Satyavati, You have done a great wrong.</p>
<p>Your son will be a fierce ksatriya, able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A brahmana is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind, when he is a learned scholar in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and forgiving.</p>
<p>A ksatriya, however, is highly qualified when he is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers.</p>
<p>These qualities are stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.42–43).</p>
<p>Because Satyavati, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she would give birth to a son imbued with the ksatriya spirit.</p>
<p>This was undesirable.</p>
<p>The son of a brahmana is generally expected to become a brahmana, but if such a son becomes fierce like a ksatriya, he is designated according to the description of the four varnas in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>If the son of a brahmana does not become like a brahmana, he may be called a ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, according to his qualifications.</p>
<p>The basic principle for dividing society is not a person’s birth but his qualities and actions.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.11</strong></p>
<p>prasaditah satyavatya</p>
<p>maivam bhur iti bhargavah</p>
<p>atha tarhi bhavet pautro</p>
<p>jamadagnis tato ’bhavat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prasaditah—pacified; satyavatya—by Satyavati; ma—not; evam—thus; bhuh—let it be; iti—thus; bhargavah—the great sage; atha—if your son should not become like that; tarhi—then; bhavet—should become like that; pautrah—the grandson; jamadagnih—Jamadagni; tatah—thereafter; abhavat—was born.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Satyavati, however, pacified Rcika Muni with peaceful words and requested that her son not be like a fierce ksatriya.</p>
<p>Rcika Muni replied, Then your grandson will be of a ksatriya spirit Thus Jamadagni was born as the son of Satyavati.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Rcika was very angry, but somehow or other Satyavati pacified him, and at her request he changed his mind.</p>
<p>It is indicated here that the son of Jamadagni would be born as Parasurama.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Satyavati later became the sacred river Kausiki to purify the entire world, and her son, Jamadagni, married Renuka, the daughter of Renu.</p>
<p>By the semen of Jamadagni, many sons, headed by Vasuman, were born from the womb of Renuka.</p>
<p>The youngest of them was named Rama, or Parasurama.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.14</strong></p>

<p>Parasurama killed all the ksatriyas on earth twenty-one times.</p>



<p><strong>9.15.15</strong></p>
<p>drptam ksatram bhuvo bharam</p>
<p>abrahmanyam aninasat</p>
<p>rajas-tamo-vrtam ahan</p>
<p>phalguny api krte ’mhasi</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>drptam—very proud; ksatram—the ksatriyas, the ruling class; bhuvah—of the earth; bharam—burden; abrahmanyam—sinful, not caring for the religious principles enunciated by the brahmanas; aninasat—drove away or annihilated; rajah-tamah—by the qualities of passion and ignorance; vrtam—covered; ahan—he killed; phalguni—not very great; api—although; krte—had been committed; amhasi—an offense.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brahmanas, Parasurama killed them.</p>
<p>Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The ksatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations enacted by great brahmanas and saintly persons.</p>
<p>As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth.</p>
<p>As stated here, rajas-tamo-vrtam, bharam abrahmanyam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power.</p>
<p>We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourth-class men.</p>
<p>Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded.</p>
<p>When the government is actually guided by brahmanas, or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people.</p>
<p>Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the brahmanas, headed by such a ksatriya-spirited brahmana as Parasurama, killed them twenty-one consecutive times.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.13), dasyu-prayesu rajasu: the ruling class (rajanya) will be no better than plunderers (dasyus) because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize the affairs of the government.</p>
<p>Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and regulations, they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.40):</p>
<p>asamskrtah kriya-hina</p>
<p>rajasa tamasavrtah</p>
<p>prajas te bhaksayisyanti</p>
<p>mleccha rajanya-rupinah</p>
<p>Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being influenced by the modes of passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), unclean people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government (rajanya-rupinah), will swallow the citizens (prajas te bhaksayisyanti).</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.7–8) says:</p>
<p>evam prajabhir dustabhir</p>
<p>akirne ksiti-mandale</p>
<p>brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam</p>
<p>yo bali bhavita nrpah</p>
<p>praja hi lubdhai rajanyair</p>
<p>nirghrnair dasyu-dharmabhih</p>
<p>acchinna-dara-dravina</p>
<p>yasyanti giri-kananam</p>
<p>Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society are not considered, the result will be brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam yo bali bhavita nrpah: the so-called caste system of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra will be meaningless.</p>
<p>As a result, whoever somehow or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the prajas, or citizens, will be so harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (yasyanti giri-kananam) to escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of plunderers.</p>
<p>Therefore the prajas, or the people in general, must take to the Krsna consciousness movement, the Hare Krsna movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the prajas become Krsna conscious, they can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of material existence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: The best of the ksatriyas, Kartaviryarjuna, the King of the Haihayas, received one thousand arms by worshiping Dattatreya, the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana.</p>
<p>He also became undefeatable by enemies and received unobstructed sensory power, beauty, influence, strength, fame and the mystic power by which to achieve all the perfections of yoga, such as anima and laghima.</p>
<p>Thus having become fully opulent, he roamed all over the universe without opposition, just like the wind.</p>

<p>This was unbearable to the ten-headed Ravana, who considered himself a great hero and could not tolerate Kartaviryarjuna’s power.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Ravana was out touring to gain victory over all other countries (dig-vijaya), and he had camped on the bank of the Narmada River near the city of Mahismati.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Ravana attempted to insult Kartaviryarjuna in the presence of the women and thus offended him, Kartaviryarjuna easily arrested Ravana and put him in custody in the city of Mahismati, just as one captures a monkey, and then released him neglectfully.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Once while Kartaviryarjuna was wandering unengaged in a solitary forest and hunting, he approached the residence of Jamadagni.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kartaviryarjuna had no business going to the residence of Jamadagni, but because he was puffed-up by his extraordinary power, he went there and offended Parasurama.</p>
<p>This was the prelude to his being killed by Parasurama for his offensive act.</p>

<p>tasmai sa naradevaya</p>
<p>munir arhanam aharat</p>
<p>sasainyamatya-vahaya</p>
<p>havismatya tapo-dhanah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasmai—unto him; sah—he (Jamadagni); naradevaya—unto King Kartaviryarjuna; munih—the great sage; arhanam—paraphernalia for worship; aharat—offered; sa-sainya—with his soldiers; amatya—his ministers; vahaya—and the chariots, the elephants, the horses or the men who carried the palanquins; havismatya—because of possessing a kamadhenu, a cow that could supply everything; tapah-dhanah—the great sage, whose only power was his austerity, or who was engaged in austerity.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sage Jamadagni, who was engaged in great austerities in the forest, received the King very well, along with the King’s soldiers, ministers and carriers.</p>
<p>He supplied all the necessities to worship these guests, for he possessed a kamadhenu cow that was able to supply everything.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Brahma-samhita informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Vrndavana, where Krsna lives, is full of surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam (Bs.5.29)).</p>
<p>The surabhi cow is also called kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Although Jamadagni possessed only one kamadhenu, he was able to get from it everything desirable.</p>
<p>Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King’s great number of followers, ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers.</p>
<p>When we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers.</p>
<p>Jamadagni was able to receive all the King’s followers properly and feed them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee.</p>
<p>The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of his offense.</p>
<p>Parasurama, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kartaviryarjuna because Kartaviryarjuna was too proud.</p>
<p>One may possess unusual opulence in this material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Parasurama became angry at Kartaviryarjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.</p>

<p>sa vai ratnam tu tad drstva</p>
<p>atmaisvaryatisayanam</p>
<p>tan nadriyatagnihotryam</p>
<p>sabhilasah sahaihayah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—he (Kartaviryarjuna); vai—indeed; ratnam—a great source of wealth; tu—indeed; tat—the kamadhenu in the possession of Jamadagni; drstva—by observing; atma-aisvarya—his own personal opulence; ati-sayanam—which was exceeding; tat—that; na—not; adriyata—appreciated very much; agnihotryam—in that cow, which was useful for executing the agnihotra sacrifice; sa-abhilasah—became desirous; sa-haihayah—with his own men, the Haihayas.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kartaviryarjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and wealthy than himself because of possessing a jewel in the form of the kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not very much appreciative of Jamadagni’s reception.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they wanted to possess that kamadhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Jamadagni was more powerful than Kartaviryarjuna because of performing the agnihotra-yajna with clarified butter received from the kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and clarified ghee, especially for performing the agnihotra-yajna.</p>
<p>This is possible for everyone.</p>
<p>Thus we find that in Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advises go-raksya, the protection of cows.</p>
<p>This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they will surely supply sufficient milk.</p>
<p>We have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms we are giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than enough milk.</p>
<p>In other farms the cows do not deliver as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill them, they are happy, and they give ample milk.</p>
<p>Therefore this instruction given by Lord Krsna—go-raksya—is extremely meaningful.</p>
<p>The whole world must learn from Krsna how to live happily without scarcity simply by producing food grains (annad bhavanti bhutani) and giving protection to the cows (go-raksya).</p>
<p>Krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam (Bg.18.44).</p>
<p>Those who belong to the third level of human society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and giving protection to cows.</p>
<p>This is the injunction of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>In the matter of protecting the cows, the meat-eaters will protest, but in answer to them we may say that since Krsna gives stress to cow protection, those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual advancement of human society.</p>

<p>havirdhanim rser darpan</p>
<p>naran hartum acodayat</p>
<p>te ca mahismatim ninyuh</p>
<p>sa-vatsam krandatim balat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>havih-dhanim—the kamadhenu; rseh—of the great sage Jamadagni; darpat—because of his being puffed up with material power; naran—all his men (soldiers); hartum—to steal or take away; acodayat—encouraged; te—the men of Kartaviryarjuna; ca—also; mahismatim—to the capital of Kartaviryarjuna; ninyuh—brought; sa-vatsam—with the calf; krandatim—crying; balat—because of being taken away by force.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Being puffed up by material power, Kartaviryarjuna encouraged his men to steal Jamadagni’s kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Thus the men forcibly took away the crying kamadhenu, along with her calf, to Mahismati, Kartaviryarjuna’s capital.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word havirdhanim is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>Havirdhanim refers to a cow required for supplying havis, or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices.</p>
<p>In human life, one should be trained to perform yajnas.</p>
<p>As we are informed in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: if we do not perform yajna, we shall simply work very hard for sense gratification like dogs and hogs.</p>
<p>This is not civilization.</p>
<p>A human being should be trained to perform yajna.</p>
<p>Yajnad bhavati parjanyah (Bg.3.14).</p>
<p>If yajnas are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for producing all the necessities of life.</p>
<p>Yajna, therefore, is essential.</p>
<p>For performing yajna, clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow protection is essential.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization, we shall certainly suffer.</p>
<p>So-called scholars and philosophers do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the hands of prakrti, nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate).</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in which everyone will be happy.</p>
<p>This is the motive of our Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Yajne sukhena bhavantu.</p>

<p>Upon seeing Parasurama, Kartaviryarjuna immediately feared him and sent many elephants, chariots, horses and infantry soldiers equipped with clubs, swords, arrows, rstis, sataghnis, saktis, and many similar weapons to fight against him.</p>
<p>Kartaviryarjuna sent seventeen full aksauhinis of soldiers to check Parasurama.</p>
<p>But Lord Parasurama alone killed all of them.</p>

<p>One chariot, one elephant, five infantry soldiers and three horses are called a patti by those who are learned in the science.</p>

<p>Three vahinis have been referred to by the learned as a prtana, three prtanas equal one camu, and three camus equal one anikini.</p>
<p>The wise refer to ten anikinis as one aksauhini.</p>
<p>The chariots of an aksauhini have been calculated at 21,870 by those who know the science of such calculations, O best of the twice-born, and the number of elephants is the same.</p>
<p>The number of infantry soldiers is 109,350, and the number of horses is 65,610.</p>
<p>This is called an aksauhini</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Different personalities become beautiful by possessing different qualities.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita says that the cuckoo bird, although very black, is beautiful because of its sweet voice.</p>
<p>Similarly, a woman becomes beautiful by her chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly person becomes beautiful when he becomes a learned scholar.</p>
<p>In the same way, brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras become beautiful by their qualities.</p>
<p>Brahmanas are beautiful when they are forgiving, ksatriyas when they are heroic and never retreat from fighting, vaisyas when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and sudras when they are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their masters.</p>
<p>Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his special qualities.</p>
<p>And the special quality of the brahmana, as described here, is forgiveness.</p>

<p>rajno murdhabhisiktasya</p>
<p>vadho brahma-vadhad guruh</p>
<p>tirtha-samsevaya camho</p>
<p>jahy angacyuta-cetanah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>rajnah—of the king; murdha-abhisiktasya—who is noted as the emperor; vadhah—the killing; brahma-vadhat—than killing a brahmana; guruh—more severe; tirtha-samsevaya—by worshiping the holy places; ca—also; amhah—the sinful act; jahi—wash out; anga—O my dear son; acyuta-cetanah—being fully Krsna conscious.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear son, killing a king who is an emperor is more severely sinful than killing a brahmana.</p>
<p>But now, if you become Krsna conscious and worship the holy places, you can atone for this great sin.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is freed from all sins (aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami).</p>
<p>From the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Sri Krsna, even the most sinful person is freed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son Parasurama to worship the holy places.</p>
<p>Because an ordinary person cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually be released from sinful reactions.</p>
