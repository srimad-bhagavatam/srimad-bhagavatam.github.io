<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#915" id="915">9.15</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Gadhi in the dynasty of Aila.</p>
<p>From the womb of Urvasi came six sons, named Ayu, Srutayu, Satyayu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya.</p>
<p>The son of Srutayu was Vasuman, the son of Satyayu was Srutanjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhima.</p>
<p>Bhima’s son was named Kancana, the son of Kancana was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the Ganges in one sip.</p>
<p>The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Balaka, Ajaka and Kusa.</p>
<p>The sons of Kusa were Kusambu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kusanabha.</p>
<p>From Kusambu came Gadhi, who had a daughter named Satyavati.</p>
<p>Satyavati married Rcika Muni after the muni contributed a substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavati by Rcika Muni, Jamadagni was born.</p>
<p>The son of Jamadagni was Rama, or Parasurama.</p>
<p>When a king named Kartaviryarjuna stole Jamadagni’s desire cow, Parasurama, who is ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kartaviryarjuna.</p>
<p>Later, he annihilated the ksatriya dynasty twenty-one times.</p>
<p>After Parasurama killed Kartaviryarjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a brahmana he should have tolerated the offense.</p>
<p>Therefore Jamadagni advised Parasurama to atone for his sin by traveling to various holy places.</p>
