<h1>The Descendants of Ajamidha</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.22</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the descendants of Divodasa.</p>
<p>It also describes Jarasandha, who belonged to the Rksa dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna and others.</p>
<p>The son of Divodasa was Mitrayu, who had four sons, one after another—Cyavana, Sudasa, Sahadeva and Somaka.</p>
<p>Somaka had one hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Prsata, from whom Drupada was born.</p>
<p>Drupada’s daughter was Draupadi, and his sons were headed by Dhrstadyumna.</p>
<p>Dhrstadyumna’s son was Dhrstaketu.</p>
<p>Another son of Ajamidha was named Rksa.</p>
<p>From Rksa came a son named Samvarana, and from Samvarana came Kuru, the king of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>Kuru had four sons—Pariksi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nisadha.</p>
<p>Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Krti and Uparicara Vasu.</p>
<p>The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Brhadratha, Kusamba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings of the Cedi state.</p>
<p>In the dynasty from Brhadratha came Kusagra, Rsabha, Satyahita, Puspavan and Jahu, and from Brhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jarasandha, who was followed by Sahadeva, Somapi and Srutasrava.</p>
<p>Pariksi, the son of Kuru, had no sons.</p>
<p>Among the descendants of Jahnu were Suratha, Viduratha, Sarvabhauma, Jayasena, Radhika, Ayutayu, Akrodhana, Devatithi, Rksa, Dilipa and Pratipa.</p>
<p>The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika.</p>
<p>When Devapi retired to the forest, his younger brother Santanu became the king.</p>
<p>Although Santanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he disregarded his elder brother.</p>
<p>Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years.</p>
<p>Following the advice of the brahmanas, Santanu was ready to return the kingdom to Devapi, but by the intrigue of Santanu’s minister, Devapi became unfit to be king.</p>
<p>Therefore Santanu resumed charge of the kingdom, and rain fell properly during his regime.</p>
<p>By mystic power, Devapi still lives in the village known as Kalapa-grama.</p>
<p>In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vamsa (the lunar dynasty) die out, Devapi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon.</p>
<p>The wife of Santanu named Ganga gave birth to Bhisma, one of the twelve authorities.</p>
<p>Two sons named Citrangada and Vicitravirya were also born from the womb of Satyavati by the semen of Santanu, and Vyasadeva was born from Satyavati by the semen of Parasara, Vyasadeva instructed the history of the Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva.</p>
<p>Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravirya, Vyasadeva begot Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.</p>
<p>Dhrtarastra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one daughter named Duhsala.</p>
<p>Pandu had five sons, headed by Yudhisthira, and each of these five sons had one son from Draupadi.</p>
<p>The names of these sons of Draupadi were Prativindhya, Srutasena, Srutakirti, Satanika and Srutakarma.</p>
<p>Besides these five sons, by other wives the Pandavas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghatotkaca, Sarvagata, Suhotra, Naramitra, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu.</p>
<p>From Abhimanyu, Maharaja Pariksit was born, and Maharaja Pariksit had four sons—Janamejaya, Srutasena, Bhimasena and Ugrasena.</p>
<p>Next Sukadeva Gosvami described the future sons of the Pandu family.</p>
<p>From Janamejaya, he said, would come a son named Satanika, and following in the dynasty would be Sahasranika, Asvamedhaja, Asimakrsna, Nemicakra, Citraratha, Suciratha, Vrstiman, Susena, Sunitha, Nrcaksu, Sukhinala, Pariplava, Sunaya, Medhavi, Nrpanjaya, Durva, Timi, Brhadratha, Sudasa, Satanika, Durdamana, Mahinara, Dandapani, Nimi and Ksemaka.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami then predicted the kings of the magadha-vamsa, or Magadha dynasty.</p>
<p>Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, would beget Marjari, and from him would come Srutasrava.</p>
<p>Subsequently taking birth in the dynasty will be Yutayu, Niramitra, Sunaksatra, Brhatsena, Karmajit, Sutanjaya, Vipra, Suci, Ksema, Suvrata, Dharmasutra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sunitha, Satyajit, Visvajit and Ripunjaya.</p>

<p>When the brahmanas said this, Maharaja Santanu went to the forest and requested his elder brother Devapi to take charge of the kingdom, for it is the duty of a king to maintain his subjects.</p>
<p>Previously, however, Santanu’s minister Asvavara had instigated some brahmanas to induce Devapi to transgress the injunctions of the Vedas and thus make himself unfit for the post of ruler.</p>
<p>The brahmanas deviated Devapi from the path of the Vedic principles, and therefore when asked by Santanu he did not agree to accept the post of ruler.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic principles and therefore became fallen.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Santanu again became the king, and Indra, being pleased, showered rains.</p>
<p>Devapi later took to the path of mystic yoga to control his mind and senses and went to the village named Kalapagrama, where he is still living.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Citrangada, of whom Vicitravirya was the younger brother, was killed by a Gandharva who was also named Citrangada.</p>
<p>Satyavati, before her marriage to Santanu, gave birth to the master authority of the Vedas, Vyasadeva, known as Krsna Dvaipayana, who was begotten by Parasara Muni.</p>
<p>From Vyasadeva, I (Sukadeva Gosvami) was born, and from him I studied this great work of literature, Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The incarnation of Godhead Vedavyasa, rejecting his disciples, headed by Paila, instructed Srimad-Bhagavatam to me because I was free from all material desires.</p>
<p>After Ambika and Ambalika, the two daughters of Kasiraja, were taken away by force, Vicitravirya married them, but because he was too attached to these two wives, he had a heart attack and died of tuberculosis.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vicitravirya died of tuberculosis, and his wives, Ambika and Ambalika, had no issue.</p>
<p>Therefore, after Vicitravirya’s death, his mother, Satyavati, who was also the mother of Vyasadeva, asked Vyasadeva to beget children through the wives of Vicitravirya.</p>
<p>In those days, the brother of the husband could beget children through the womb of his sister-in-law.</p>
<p>This was known as devarena sutotpatti.</p>
<p>If the husband was somehow unable to beget children, his brother could do so through the womb of his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Babhruvahana became the adopted son of the king of Manipura.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is to be understood that Parvati is the daughter of the king of the very, very old mountainous country known as the Manipura state.</p>
<p>Five thousand years ago, therefore, when the Pandavas ruled, Manipura existed, as did its king.</p>
<p>Therefore this kingdom is a very old, aristocratic Vaisnava kingdom.</p>
<p>If this kingdom is organized as a Vaisnava state, this revitalization will be a great success because for five thousand years this state has maintained its identity.</p>
<p>If the Vaisnava spirit is revived there, it will be a wonderful place, renowned throughout the entire world.</p>
<p>Manipuri Vaisnavas are very famous in Vaisnava society.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana and Navadvipa there are many temples constructed by the king of Manipura.</p>
<p>Some of our devotees belong to the Manipura state.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, can be well spread in the state of Manipura by the cooperative efforts of the Krsna conscious devotees.</p>
