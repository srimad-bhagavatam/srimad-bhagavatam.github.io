<h1><a class="header" href="#the-descendants-of-ajamidha" id="the-descendants-of-ajamidha">The Descendants of Ajamidha</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#922" id="922">9.22</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the descendants of Divodasa.</p>
<p>It also describes Jarasandha, who belonged to the Rksa dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna and others.</p>
<p>The son of Divodasa was Mitrayu, who had four sons, one after another—Cyavana, Sudasa, Sahadeva and Somaka.</p>
<p>Somaka had one hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Prsata, from whom Drupada was born.</p>
<p>Drupada’s daughter was Draupadi, and his sons were headed by Dhrstadyumna.</p>
<p>Dhrstadyumna’s son was Dhrstaketu.</p>
<p>Another son of Ajamidha was named Rksa.</p>
<p>From Rksa came a son named Samvarana, and from Samvarana came Kuru, the king of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>Kuru had four sons—Pariksi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nisadha.</p>
<p>Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Krti and Uparicara Vasu.</p>
<p>The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Brhadratha, Kusamba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings of the Cedi state.</p>
<p>In the dynasty from Brhadratha came Kusagra, Rsabha, Satyahita, Puspavan and Jahu, and from Brhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jarasandha, who was followed by Sahadeva, Somapi and Srutasrava.</p>
<p>Pariksi, the son of Kuru, had no sons.</p>
<p>Among the descendants of Jahnu were Suratha, Viduratha, Sarvabhauma, Jayasena, Radhika, Ayutayu, Akrodhana, Devatithi, Rksa, Dilipa and Pratipa.</p>
<p>The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika.</p>
<p>When Devapi retired to the forest, his younger brother Santanu became the king.</p>
<p>Although Santanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he disregarded his elder brother.</p>
<p>Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years.</p>
<p>Following the advice of the brahmanas, Santanu was ready to return the kingdom to Devapi, but by the intrigue of Santanu’s minister, Devapi became unfit to be king.</p>
<p>Therefore Santanu resumed charge of the kingdom, and rain fell properly during his regime.</p>
<p>By mystic power, Devapi still lives in the village known as Kalapa-grama.</p>
<p>In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vamsa (the lunar dynasty) die out, Devapi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon.</p>
<p>The wife of Santanu named Ganga gave birth to Bhisma, one of the twelve authorities.</p>
<p>Two sons named Citrangada and Vicitravirya were also born from the womb of Satyavati by the semen of Santanu, and Vyasadeva was born from Satyavati by the semen of Parasara, Vyasadeva instructed the history of the Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva.</p>
<p>Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravirya, Vyasadeva begot Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.</p>
<p>Dhrtarastra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one daughter named Duhsala.</p>
<p>Pandu had five sons, headed by Yudhisthira, and each of these five sons had one son from Draupadi.</p>
<p>The names of these sons of Draupadi were Prativindhya, Srutasena, Srutakirti, Satanika and Srutakarma.</p>
<p>Besides these five sons, by other wives the Pandavas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghatotkaca, Sarvagata, Suhotra, Naramitra, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu.</p>
<p>From Abhimanyu, Maharaja Pariksit was born, and Maharaja Pariksit had four sons—Janamejaya, Srutasena, Bhimasena and Ugrasena.</p>
<p>Next Sukadeva Gosvami described the future sons of the Pandu family.</p>
<p>From Janamejaya, he said, would come a son named Satanika, and following in the dynasty would be Sahasranika, Asvamedhaja, Asimakrsna, Nemicakra, Citraratha, Suciratha, Vrstiman, Susena, Sunitha, Nrcaksu, Sukhinala, Pariplava, Sunaya, Medhavi, Nrpanjaya, Durva, Timi, Brhadratha, Sudasa, Satanika, Durdamana, Mahinara, Dandapani, Nimi and Ksemaka.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami then predicted the kings of the magadha-vamsa, or Magadha dynasty.</p>
<p>Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, would beget Marjari, and from him would come Srutasrava.</p>
<p>Subsequently taking birth in the dynasty will be Yutayu, Niramitra, Sunaksatra, Brhatsena, Karmajit, Sutanjaya, Vipra, Suci, Ksema, Suvrata, Dharmasutra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sunitha, Satyajit, Visvajit and Ripunjaya.</p>
