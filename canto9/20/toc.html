<h1><a class="header" href="#the-dynasty-of-puru" id="the-dynasty-of-puru">The Dynasty of Puru</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#920" id="920">9.20</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Puru and his descendant Dusmanta.</p>
<p>The son of Puru was Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvan.</p>
<p>The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvan, one after another, were Pravira, Manusyu, Carupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Samyati, Ahamyati and Raudrasva.</p>
<p>Raudrasva had ten sons—Rteyu, Kakseyu, Sthandileyu, Krteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu.</p>
<p>The son of Rteyu was Rantinava, who had three sons—Sumati, Dhruva and Apratiratha.</p>
<p>The son of Apratiratha was Kanva, and Kanva’s son was Medhatithi.</p>
<p>The sons of Medhatithi, headed by Praskanna, were all brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Rantinava named Sumati had a son named Rebhi, and his son was Dusmanta.</p>
<p>While hunting in the forest, Dusmanta once approached the asrama of Maharsi Kanva, where he saw an extremely beautiful woman and became attracted to her.</p>
<p>That woman was the daughter of Visvamitra, and her name was Sakuntala.</p>
<p>Her mother was Menaka, who had left her in the forest, where Kanva Muni found her.</p>
<p>Kanva Muni brought her to his asrama, where he raised and maintained her.</p>
<p>When Sakuntala accepted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband, he married her according to the gandharva-vidhi.</p>
<p>Sakuntala later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the asrama of Kanva Muni and returned to his kingdom.</p>
<p>In due course of time, Sakuntala gave birth to a Vaisnava son, but Dusmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Sakuntala approached him with her newly born child, Maharaja Dusmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son.</p>
<p>Later, however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them.</p>
<p>After Maharaja Dusmanta’s death, Bharata, the son of Sakuntala, was enthroned.</p>
<p>He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadvaja and how Maharaja Bharata accepted Bharadvaja as his son.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of Maharaja Bharata, I shall now describe the dynasty of Puru, in which you were born, in which many saintly kings appeared, and from which many dynasties of brahmanas began.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many historical instances by which we can understand that from ksatriyas many brahmanas have been born and that from brahmanas many ksatriyas have been born.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the symptoms of a particular section, he is to be described accordingly.</p>
<p>Yal-laksanam proktam.</p>
<p>One’s place in the varna divisions of society is determined according to one’s symptoms or qualities.</p>
<p>This is maintained everywhere in the sastra.</p>
<p>Birth is a secondary consideration; the first consideration is one’s qualities and activities.</p>
