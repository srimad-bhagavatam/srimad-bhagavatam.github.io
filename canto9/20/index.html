<h1>The Dynasty of Puru</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.20</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Puru and his descendant Dusmanta.</p>
<p>The son of Puru was Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvan.</p>
<p>The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvan, one after another, were Pravira, Manusyu, Carupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Samyati, Ahamyati and Raudrasva.</p>
<p>Raudrasva had ten sons—Rteyu, Kakseyu, Sthandileyu, Krteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu.</p>
<p>The son of Rteyu was Rantinava, who had three sons—Sumati, Dhruva and Apratiratha.</p>
<p>The son of Apratiratha was Kanva, and Kanva’s son was Medhatithi.</p>
<p>The sons of Medhatithi, headed by Praskanna, were all brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Rantinava named Sumati had a son named Rebhi, and his son was Dusmanta.</p>
<p>While hunting in the forest, Dusmanta once approached the asrama of Maharsi Kanva, where he saw an extremely beautiful woman and became attracted to her.</p>
<p>That woman was the daughter of Visvamitra, and her name was Sakuntala.</p>
<p>Her mother was Menaka, who had left her in the forest, where Kanva Muni found her.</p>
<p>Kanva Muni brought her to his asrama, where he raised and maintained her.</p>
<p>When Sakuntala accepted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband, he married her according to the gandharva-vidhi.</p>
<p>Sakuntala later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the asrama of Kanva Muni and returned to his kingdom.</p>
<p>In due course of time, Sakuntala gave birth to a Vaisnava son, but Dusmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Sakuntala approached him with her newly born child, Maharaja Dusmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son.</p>
<p>Later, however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them.</p>
<p>After Maharaja Dusmanta’s death, Bharata, the son of Sakuntala, was enthroned.</p>
<p>He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadvaja and how Maharaja Bharata accepted Bharadvaja as his son.</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of Maharaja Bharata, I shall now describe the dynasty of Puru, in which you were born, in which many saintly kings appeared, and from which many dynasties of brahmanas began.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many historical instances by which we can understand that from ksatriyas many brahmanas have been born and that from brahmanas many ksatriyas have been born.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the symptoms of a particular section, he is to be described accordingly.</p>
<p>Yal-laksanam proktam.</p>
<p>One’s place in the varna divisions of society is determined according to one’s symptoms or qualities.</p>
<p>This is maintained everywhere in the sastra.</p>
<p>Birth is a secondary consideration; the first consideration is one’s qualities and activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Dusmanta replied: O Sakuntala, with beautiful eyebrows, you have taken your birth in the family of the great saint Visvamitra, and your reception is quite worthy of your family.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the daughters of a king generally select their own husbands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In her reception of Maharaja Dusmanta, Sakuntala clearly said, Your Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can offer Thus she indicated that she wanted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband.</p>
<p>As far as Maharaja Dusmanta was concerned, he desired Sakuntala as his wife from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural.</p>
<p>To induce Sakuntala to accept the marriage, Maharaja Dusmanta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she could select her husband in an open assembly.</p>
<p>In the history of Aryan civilization there have been many instances in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open competitions.</p>
<p>For example, it was in such a competition that Sitadevi accepted Lord Ramacandra as her husband and that Draupadi accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances.</p>
<p>So marriage by agreement or by selecting one’s own husband in an open competition is allowed.</p>
<p>There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is called gandharva marriage.</p>
<p>Generally the parents select the husband or wife for their daughter or son, but gandharva marriage takes place by personal selection.</p>
<p>Still, although marriage by personal selection or by agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by disagreement.</p>
<p>Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal ksatriya families.</p>
<p>Maharaja Dusmanta’s acceptance of Sakuntala as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic culture.</p>
<p>How the marriage took place is described in the next verse.</p>



<p><strong>9.20.16</strong></p>
<p>om ity ukte yatha-dharmam</p>
<p>upayeme sakuntalam</p>
<p>gandharva-vidhina raja</p>
<p>desa-kala-vidhanavit</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>om iti ukte—by reciting the Vedic pranava, invoking the Supreme Personality of Godhead to witness the marriage; yatha-dharmam—exactly according to the principles of religion (because Narayana becomes the witness in an ordinary religious marriage also); upayeme—he married; sakuntalam—the girl Sakuntala; gandharva-vidhina—by the regulative principle of the Gandharvas, without deviation from religious principles; raja—Maharaja Dusmanta; desa-kala-vidhana-vit—completely aware of duties according to time, position and objective.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Sakuntala responded to Maharaja Dusmanta’s proposal with silence, the agreement was complete.</p>
<p>Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting the Vedic pranava (omkara), in accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The omkara, pranava, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented by letters.Bhagavad-gita says that the letters a-u-m, combined together as om, represent the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Religious principles are meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles.</p>
<p>The word vidhina means, according to religious principles The association of men and women according to religious principles is allowed in the Vedic culture.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed.</p>

<p>Maharaja Dusmanta knew that Sakuntala and the boy were his own wife and son, but because they came from outside and were unknown to the citizens, he at first declined to accept them.</p>
<p>Sakuntala, however, was so chaste that an omen from the sky declared the truth so that others could hear.</p>
<p>When everyone heard from the omen that Sakuntala and her child were truly the King’s wife and son, the King gladly accepted them.</p>



<p><strong>9.20.21</strong></p>
<p>mata bhastra pituh putro</p>
<p>yena jatah sa eva sah</p>
<p>bharasva putram dusmanta</p>
<p>mavamamsthah sakuntalam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mata—the mother; bhastra—just like the skin of a bellows containing air; pituh—of the father; putrah—the son; yena—by whom; jatah—one is born; sah—the father; eva—indeed; sah—the son; bharasva—just maintain; putram—your son; dusmanta—O Maharaja Dusmanta; ma—do not; avamamsthah—insult; sakuntalam—Sakuntala.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The voice said: O Maharaja Dusmanta, a son actually belongs to his father, whereas the mother is only a container, like the skin of a bellows.</p>
<p>According to Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the son.</p>
<p>Therefore, maintain your own son and do not insult Sakuntala.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic injunction atma vai putra-namasi, the father becomes the son.</p>
<p>The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is responsible for maintaining the son.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He is the seed-giving father of all living entities (aham bija-pradah pita), and therefore He is responsible for maintaining them.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman: although God is one, He maintains all living entities with their necessities for life.</p>
<p>The living entities in different forms are sons of the Lord, and therefore the father, the Supreme Lord, supplies them food according to their different bodies.</p>
<p>The small ant is supplied a grain of sugar, and the elephant is supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat.</p>
<p>Therefore there is no question of overpopulation.</p>
<p>Because the father, Krsna, is fully opulent, there is no scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth.</p>
<p>Actually one suffers for want of food when material nature, under the order of the father, refuses to supply him food.</p>
<p>It is the living entity’s position that determines whether food will be supplied or not.</p>
<p>When a diseased person is forbidden to eat, this does not mean that there is a scarcity of food; rather, the diseased person requires the treatment of not being supplied with food.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (7.10) the Lord also says, bijam mam sama-bhutanam: I am the seed of all living entities A particular type of seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant comes out.</p>
<p>The mother resembles the earth, and when a particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth.</p>



<p><strong>9.20.22</strong></p>
<p>reto-dhah putro nayati</p>
<p>naradeva yama-ksayat</p>
<p>tvam casya dhata garbhasya</p>
<p>satyam aha sakuntala</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>retah-dhah—a person who discharges semen; putrah—the son; nayati—saves; nara-deva—O King (Maharaja Dusmanta); yama-ksayat—from punishment by Yamaraja, or from the custody of Yamaraja; tvam—your good self; ca—and; asya—of this child; dhata—the creator; garbhasya—of the embryo; satyam—truthfully; aha—said; sakuntala—your wife, Sakuntala.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Dusmanta, he who discharges semen is the actual father, and his son saves him from the custody of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>You are the actual procreator of this child.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sakuntala is speaking the truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Upon hearing the omen, Maharaja Dusmanta accepted his wife and child.</p>
<p>According to Vedic smrti:</p>
<p>pun-namno narakad yasmat</p>
<p>pitaram trayate sutah</p>
<p>tasmat putra iti proktah</p>
<p>svayam eva svayambhuva</p>
<p>Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called put, the son is called putra.</p>
<p>According to this principle, when there is a disagreement between the father and mother, it is the father, not the mother, who is delivered by the son.</p>
<p>But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition.</p>
<p>This verse clearly says, putro nayati naradeva yama-ksayat: The son saves his father from the custody of Yamaraja It never says, putro nayati mataram: The son saves his mother The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother.</p>
<p>Consequently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for if they have a child whom they raise to be a Vaisnava, he can save both the father and mother from the custody of Yamaraja and punishment in hellish life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: When Maharaja Dusmanta passed away from this earth, his son became the emperor of the world, the proprietor of the seven islands.</p>
<p>He is referred to as a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (10.41) it is said:</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Bharata, the son of Dusmanta, had the mark of Lord Krsna’s disc on the palm of his right hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet.</p>
<p>By worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire world.</p>
<p>Then, under the priesthood of Mamateya, Bhrgu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse sacrifices on the bank of the Yamuna, beginning from the confluence at Prayaga and ending at the source.</p>
<p>He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brahmanas had one badva (13,084) as his share.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As indicated here by the words dausmanter agnih saci-gune citah, Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dusmanta, arranged for many ritualistic ceremonies all over the world, especially all over India on the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna, from the mouth to the source, and all such sacrifices were performed in very distinguished places.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world Everyone should engage in the performance of yajna, and the sacrificial fire should be ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified brahmanas who could perform such yajnas.</p>
<p>For the present, however, the Brahma-vaivarta Purana enjoins:</p>
<p>asvamedham gavalambham</p>
<p>sannyasam pala-paitrkam</p>
<p>devarena sutotpattim</p>
<p>kalau panca vivarjayet</p>
<p>(Cc.Adi 17.164)</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice, offering a cow in sacrifice, accepting the order of sannyasa, offering oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the wife of one’s brother In this age, such yajnas as the asvamedha-yajna and gomedha-yajna are impossible to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified brahmanas.</p>
<p>This verse says, mamateyam purodhaya: Maharaja Bharata engaged the son of Mamata, Bhrgu Muni, to take charge of performing this yajna.</p>
<p>Now, however, such brahmanas are impossible to find.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastras recommend, yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are intelligent should perform the sankirtana-yajna inaugurated by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam</p>
<p>sangopangastra-parsadam</p>
<p>yajnaih sankirtana-prayair</p>
<p>yajanti hi sumedhasah</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sankirtana-yajna (Bhag.11.5.32) Yajna must be performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely.</p>
<p>Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare Krsna all over the world.</p>
<p>This Hare Krsna movement is also yajna, but without the difficulties involved in securing paraphernalia and qualified brahmanas.</p>
<p>This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yajna will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be any produce (annad bhavanti bhutani parjanyad anna-sambhavah).</p>
<p>All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall (kamam vavarsa parjanyah (SB 1.10.4)), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (sarva-kama-dugha mahi).</p>
<p>In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life—illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling—and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally.</p>
<p>Everything will be in proper order.</p>

<p>As one cannot approach the heavenly planes simply by the strength of his arms (for who can touch the heavenly planes with his hands?), one cannot imitate the wonderful activities of Maharaja Bharata.</p>

<p>His sons and family had seemed to him to be his entire life.</p>
<p>But finally he thought of all this as an impediment to spiritual advancement, and therefore he ceased from enjoying it.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Bharata had incomparable opulence in sovereignty, soldiers, sons, daughters and everything for material enjoyment, but when he realized that all such material opulences were useless for spiritual advancement, he retired from material enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Vedic civilization enjoins that after a certain age, following in the footsteps of Maharaja Bharata, one should cease to enjoy material opulences and should take the order of vanaprastha.</p>

<p>The son within her womb forbid this, but Brhaspati cursed him and forcibly discharged semen into the womb of Mamata.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The sex impulse is so strong in this material world that even Brhaspati, who is supposed to be the priest of the demigods and a very learned scholar, wanted to have a sexual relationship with his brother’s pregnant wife.</p>
<p>This can happen even in the society of the higher demigods, so what to speak of human society? The sex impulse is so strong that it can agitate even a learned personality like Brhaspati.</p>



<p><strong>9.20.37</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Mamata very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to an illegitimate son, and therefore she considered giving up the child.</p>
<p>But then the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a name for the child.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as jata-karma and nama-karana, in which learned brahmanas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope according to astrological calculations.</p>
<p>But the child to which Mamata gave birth was begotten by Brhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamata was the wife of Utathya, Brhaspati made her pregnant by force.</p>
<p>Therefore Brhaspati became bharta.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dvaja.</p>
<p>The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is dogla, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother.</p>
<p>In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles.</p>
<p>Mamata, therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvaja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamata and Brhaspati.</p>



<p><strong>9.20.38</strong></p>
<p>mudhe bhara dvajam imam</p>
<p>bhara dvajam brhaspate</p>
<p>yatau yad uktva pitarau</p>
<p>bharadvajas tatas tv ayam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mudhe—O foolish woman; bhara—just maintain; dvajam—although born by an illicit connection between two; imam—this child; bhara—maintain; dvajam—although born by an illicit connection between two; brhaspate—O Brhaspati; yatau—left; yat—because; uktva—having said; pitarau—both the father and mother; bharadvajah—by the name Bharadvaja; tatah—thereafter; tu—indeed; ayam—this child.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Brhaspati said to Mamata, You foolish woman, although this child was born from the wife of one man through the semen discharged by another, you should maintain him Upon hearing this, Mamata replied, O Brhaspati, you maintain him After speaking in this way, Brhaspati and Mamata both left.</p>
<p>Thus the child was known as Bharadvaja.</p>



<p><strong>9.20.39</strong></p>
<p>codyamana surair evam</p>
<p>matva vitatham atmajam</p>
<p>vyasrjan maruto ’bibhran</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>codyamana—although Mamata was encouraged (to maintain the child); suraih—by the demigods; evam—in this way; matva—considering; vitatham—purposeless; atmajam—her own child; vyasrjat—rejected; marutah—the demigods known as the Maruts; abibhran—maintained (the child); dattah—the same child was given; ayam—this; vitathe—was disappointed; anvaye—when the dynasty of Maharaja Bharata.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although encouraged by the demigods to maintain the child, Mamata considered him useless because of his illicit birth, and therefore she left him.</p>
<p>Consequently, the demigods known as the Maruts maintained the child, and when Maharaja Bharata was disappointed for want of a child, this child was given to him as his son.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From this verse it is understood that those who are rejected from the higher planeary system are given a chance to take birth in the most exalted families on this planet earth.</p>
