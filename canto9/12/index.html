<h1>The Dynasty of Kusa, the Son of Lord Ramacandra</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.12</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty of Kusa, the son of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>The members of this dynasty are descendants of Sasada, the son of Maharaja Iksvaku.</p>
<p>Following in the genealogical table of Lord Ramacandra’s dynasty, Kusa, the Lord’s son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Nisadha, Nabha, Pundarika, Ksemadhanva, Devanika, Aniha, Pariyatra, Balasthala, Vajranabha, Sagana and Vidhrti.</p>
<p>These personalities ruled the world.</p>
<p>From Vidhrti came Hiranyanabha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in which Yajnavalkya was initiated.</p>
<p>Following in this dynasty were Puspa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudarsana, Agnivarna, Sighra and Maru.</p>
<p>Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the village of Kalapa.</p>
<p>At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the sun-god.</p>
<p>Next in the dynasty were Prasusruta, Sandhi, Amarsana, Mahasvan, Visvabahu, Prasenajit, Taksaka and Brhadbala, who was later killed by Abhimanyu.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said that these were all kings who had passed away.</p>
<p>The future descendants of Brhadbala will be Brhadrana, Urukriya, Vatsavrddha, Prativyoma, Bhanu, Divaka, Sahadeva, Brhadasva, Bhanuman, Pratikasva, Supratika, Marudeva, Sunaksatra, Puskara, Antariksa, Sutapa, Amitrajit, Brhadraja, Barhi, Krtanjaya, Rananjaya, Sanjaya, Sakya, Suddhoda, Langala, Prasenajit, Ksudraka, Ranaka, Suratha and Sumitra.</p>
<p>All of them will become kings one after another.</p>
<p>Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last king in the Iksvaku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be extinguished.</p>

<p>Having achieved perfection in the power of mystic yoga, Maru still lives in a place known as Kalapa-grama.</p>
<p>At the end of Kali-yuga, he will revive the lost Surya dynasty by begetting a son.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>At least five thousand years ago, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami ascertained the existence of Maru in Kalapa-grama and said that Maru, having achieved a yoga-siddha body, would continue to exist until the end of Kali-yuga, which is calculated to continue for 432,000 years.</p>
<p>Such is the perfection of mystic power.</p>
<p>By controlling the breath, the perfect yogi can continue his life for as long as he likes.</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear from the Vedic literature that some personalities from the Vedic age, such as Vyasadeva and Asvatthama, are still living.</p>
<p>Here we understand that Maru is also still living.</p>
<p>We are sometimes surprised that a mortal body can live for such a long time.</p>
<p>The explanation of this longevity is given here by the word yoga-siddha.</p>
<p>If one becomes perfect in the practice of yoga, he can live as long as he likes.</p>
<p>The demonstration of some trifling yoga-siddha does not constitute perfection.</p>
<p>Here is a factual example of perfection: a yoga-siddha can live as long as he likes.</p>
