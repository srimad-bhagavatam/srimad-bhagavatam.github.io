<h1><a class="header" href="#the-dynasty-of-kusa-the-son-of-lord-ramacandra" id="the-dynasty-of-kusa-the-son-of-lord-ramacandra">The Dynasty of Kusa, the Son of Lord Ramacandra</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#912" id="912">9.12</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty of Kusa, the son of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>The members of this dynasty are descendants of Sasada, the son of Maharaja Iksvaku.</p>
<p>Following in the genealogical table of Lord Ramacandra’s dynasty, Kusa, the Lord’s son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Nisadha, Nabha, Pundarika, Ksemadhanva, Devanika, Aniha, Pariyatra, Balasthala, Vajranabha, Sagana and Vidhrti.</p>
<p>These personalities ruled the world.</p>
<p>From Vidhrti came Hiranyanabha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in which Yajnavalkya was initiated.</p>
<p>Following in this dynasty were Puspa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudarsana, Agnivarna, Sighra and Maru.</p>
<p>Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the village of Kalapa.</p>
<p>At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the sun-god.</p>
<p>Next in the dynasty were Prasusruta, Sandhi, Amarsana, Mahasvan, Visvabahu, Prasenajit, Taksaka and Brhadbala, who was later killed by Abhimanyu.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said that these were all kings who had passed away.</p>
<p>The future descendants of Brhadbala will be Brhadrana, Urukriya, Vatsavrddha, Prativyoma, Bhanu, Divaka, Sahadeva, Brhadasva, Bhanuman, Pratikasva, Supratika, Marudeva, Sunaksatra, Puskara, Antariksa, Sutapa, Amitrajit, Brhadraja, Barhi, Krtanjaya, Rananjaya, Sanjaya, Sakya, Suddhoda, Langala, Prasenajit, Ksudraka, Ranaka, Suratha and Sumitra.</p>
<p>All of them will become kings one after another.</p>
<p>Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last king in the Iksvaku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be extinguished.</p>
