<h1>King Pururava Enchanted by Urvasi</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.14</strong></p>
<p>The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows.</p>
<p>This chapter describes Soma and how he kidnapped the wife of Brhaspati and begot in her womb a son named Budha.</p>
<p>Budha begot Pururava, who begot six sons, headed by Ayu, in the womb of Urvasi.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Brahma had a son named Atri, and Atri’s son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars.</p>
<p>Soma became the conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tara, who was the wife of Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods.</p>
<p>A great fight ensued between the demigods and the asuras, but Brahma rescued Brhaspati’s wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the fighting.</p>
<p>In the womb of Tara, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the womb of Ila a son named Aila, or Pururava.</p>
<p>Urvasi was captivated by Pururava’s beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman.</p>
<p>While traveling all over the world, he met Urvasi again at Kuruksetra, but she agreed to join with him for only one night in a year.</p>
<p>One year later, Pururava saw Urvasi at Kuruksetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief.</p>
<p>Urvasi then advised Pururava to worship the Gandharvas.</p>
<p>Being satisfied with Pururava, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as Agnisthali.</p>
<p>Pururava mistook Agnisthali for Urvasi, but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company.</p>
<p>After returning home and meditating upon Urvasi all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire.</p>
<p>Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthali, and there he saw that from the womb of a sami tree had come an asvattha tree.</p>
<p>Pururava made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire.</p>
<p>By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires.</p>
<p>The fire was considered the son of Pururava.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga there was only one social division, called hamsa; there were no divisions of varna like brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra.</p>
<p>The Veda was the omkara.</p>
<p>The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.</p>

<p>Now hear the most glorious and purifying description of the dynasty of the moon-god.</p>

<p><strong>9.14.3</strong></p>
<p>tasya drgbhyo ’bhavat putrah</p>
<p>somo ’mrtamayah kila</p>
<p>viprausadhy-udu-gananam</p>
<p>brahmana kalpitah patih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p>From Atri’s tears of jubilation was born a son named Soma, the moon, who was full of soothing rays.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma appointed him the director of the brahmanas, drugs and luminaries.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (candrama manaso jatah).</p>
<p>But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri.</p>
<p>This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium.</p>
<p>When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.1.15) we find this verse:</p>
<p>atreh patny anasuya trin</p>
<p>jajne suyasasah sutan</p>
<p>dattam durvasasam somam</p>
<p>atmesa-brahma-sambhavan</p>
<p>This verse describes that Anasuya, the wife of Atri Rsi, bore three sons—Soma, Durvasa and Dattatreya.</p>
<p>It is said that at the time of conception Anasuya was impregnated by the tears of Atri.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After conquering the three worlds (the upper, middle and lower planetary systems), Soma, the moon-god, performed a great sacrifice known as the Rajasuya-yajna.</p>
<p>Because he was very much puffed up, he forcibly kidnapped Brhaspati’s wife, whose name was Tara.</p>

<p>Consequently, a fight ensued between the demigods and the demons.</p>

<p>To counteract this situation, Lord Siva, who was affectionate toward Brhaspati, joined Brhaspati.</p>
<p>The father of Brhaspati was Angira, from whom Lord Siva had received knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Siva had some affection for Brhaspati and joined his side in this fight.</p>

<p>I know that although you are unchaste, you wanted a son.</p>
<p>Therefore I shall not punish you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Tara was married to Brhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she should have been impregnated by him.</p>
<p>But instead she preferred to be impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was unchaste.</p>
<p>Although Brhaspati accepted Tara from Brahma, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted her to deliver a son immediately.</p>
<p>Tara certainly very much feared her husband, and she thought she might be punished after giving birth.</p>
<p>Thus Brhaspati assured her that he would not punish her, for although she was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly, she wanted a son.</p>

<p>My dear King Pururava, please give protection to these two lambs, who have fallen down with me.</p>

<p>I have no objection to accepting you as my husband, for you are superior in every respect.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.40), yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam.</p>
<p>There are various planets and various atmospheres within this universe.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the heavenly planet from which Urvasi descended after being cursed by Mitra and Varuna was different from the atmosphere of this earth.</p>
<p>Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are certainly far superior to the inhabitants of earth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Urvasi agreed to remain the consort of Pururava, although she belonged to a superior community.</p>
<p>A woman who finds a man with superior qualities may accept such a man as her husband.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a man finds a woman who is from an inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by Sri Canakya Pandita (stri-ratnam duskulad api).</p>
<p>The combination of male and female is worthwhile if the qualities of both are on an equal level.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Pururava replied: O beautiful one, your beauty is wonderful and your gestures are also wonderful.</p>
<p>Indeed, you are attractive to all human society.</p>
<p>Therefore, since you have come of your own accord from the heavenly planets, who on earth would not agree to serve a demigoddess such as you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears from the words of Urvasi that the standard of living, eating, behavior and speech are all different on the heavenly planets from the standards on this planet earth.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the heavenly planets do not eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat is prepared in clarified butter.</p>
<p>Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>To live naked or almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live completely naked.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many clubs and societies for this purpose.</p>
<p>Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well behaved and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness.</p>
<p>These are some of the distinctions between the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and the inhabitants of earth.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero.</p>
<p>Don’t be impatient and give up your life.</p>
<p>Be sober and don’t allow the senses to overcome you like foxes.</p>
<p>Don’t let the foxes eat you.</p>
<p>In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses.</p>
<p>Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox.</p>
<p>There is no use making friendship with women.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Canakya Pandita has advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: Never place your faith in a woman or a politician Unless elevated to spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen, what to speak of women, who are less intelligent than men.</p>
<p>Women have been compared to sudras and vaisyas (striyo vaisyas tatha sudrah).</p>
<p>On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of Krsna consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, sudra or whatever, everyone is equal.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Urvasi, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature of women, said that a woman’s heart is like that of a sly fox.</p>
<p>If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes.</p>
<p>But if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at home and go to the forest mata yasya grhe nasti</p>
<p>bharya capriya-vadini</p>
<p>aranyam tena gantavyam</p>
<p>yatharanyam tatha grham</p>
<p>(Canakya-sloka57)</p>
<p>Krsna conscious grhasthas must be very careful of the sly fox woman.</p>
<p>If the wife at home is obedient and follows her husband in Krsna consciousness, the home is welcome.</p>
<p>Otherwise one should give up one’s home and go to the forest hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam</p>

<p>(Bhag.7.5.5)</p>
<p>One should go to the forest and take shelter of the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Women as a class are merciless and cunning.</p>
<p>They cannot tolerate even a slight offense.</p>
<p>For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>King Pururava was greatly attached to Urvasi.</p>
<p>Yet despite his faithfulness to her, she had left him.</p>
<p>Now, considering that the King was wasting his rarely achieved human form of life, Urvasi frankly explained the nature of a woman.</p>
<p>Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required.</p>
<p>To say nothing of her husband, she can even kill her brother.</p>
<p>That is a woman’s nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the material world, unless women are trained to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, there cannot be peace or prosperity in society.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Women are very easily seduced by men.</p>
<p>Therefore, polluted women give up the friendship of a man who is their well-wisher and establish false friendship among fools.</p>
<p>Indeed, they seek newer and newer friends, one after another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Because women are easily seduced, the Manu-samhita enjoins that they should not be given freedom.</p>
<p>A woman must always be protected, either by her father, by her husband, or by her elderly son.</p>
<p>If women are given freedom to mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to be, they cannot keep their propriety.</p>
<p>The nature of a woman, as personally described by Urvasi, is to establish false friendship with someone and then seek new male companions, one after another, even if this means giving up the company of a sincere well-wisher.</p>



<p><strong>9.14.39</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my dear King, you will be able to enjoy with me as my husband at the end of every year, for one night only.</p>
<p>In this way you will have other children, one after another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Urvasi had adversely explained the nature of woman, Maharaja Pururava was very much attached to her, and therefore she wanted to give the King some concession by agreeing to be his wife for one night at the end of each year.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, there at Kuruksetra, he again obtained the association of Urvasi, who was then the mother of a heroic son.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Having regained Urvasi at the end of the year, King Pururava was most jubilant, and he enjoyed her company in sex for one night.</p>
<p>But then he was very sorry at the thought of separation from her, so Urvasi spoke to him as follows.</p>



<p><strong>9.14.42</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Urvasi said: My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for they will be able to deliver me to you again In accordance with these words, the King satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the Gandharvas, being pleased with him, gave him an Agnisthali girl who looked exactly like Urvasi.</p>
<p>Thinking that the girl was Urvasi, the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he could understand that she was not Urvasi but Agnisthali.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Pururava was very lusty.</p>
<p>Immediately after getting the Agnisthali girl, he wanted to have sex with her, but during sexual intercourse he could understand that the girl was Agnisthali, not Urvasi.</p>
<p>This indicates that every man attached to a particular woman knows the particular characteristics of that woman during sex life.</p>
<p>Thus Pururava understood during sexual intercourse that the Agnisthali girl was not Urvasi.</p>



<p><strong>9.14.43</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pururava then left Agnisthali in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon Urvasi.</p>
<p>In the course of his meditation, the Treta millennium began, and therefore the principles of the three Vedas, including the process of performing yajna to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, tretayam yajato makhaih: in Treta-yuga, if one performed yajnas, he would get the results of those yajnas.</p>
<p>By performing visnu-yajna specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Of course, yajna is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>While Pururava was meditating upon Urvasi, the Treta-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic yajnas were revealed in his heart.</p>
<p>But Pururava was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses.</p>
<p>Yajnas for enjoyment of the senses are called karma-kandiya-yajnas.</p>
<p>Therefore, he decided to perform karma-kandiya-yajnas to fulfill his lusty desires.</p>
<p>In other words, karma-kandiya-yajnas are meant for sensuous persons, whereas yajna should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the sankirtana-yajna is recommended.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (SB 11.5.32).</p>
<p>Only those who are very intelligent take to sankirtana-yajna to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform karma-kandiya-yajnas.</p>

<p>sthali-sthanam—the place where Agnisthali was left; gatah—going there; asvattham—an asvattha tree; sami-garbham—produced from the womb of the sami tree; vilaksya—seeing; sah—he, Pururava; tena—from that; dve—two; arani—pieces of wood required for igniting a fire for sacrifice; krtva—making; urvasi-loka-kamyaya—desiring to go to the planet where Urvasi was present; urvasim—Urvasi; mantratah—by chanting the required mantra; dhyayan—meditating upon; adhara—lower; aranim—arani wood; uttaram—and the upper one; atmanam—himself; ubhayoh madhye—in between the two; yat tat—that which (he meditated upon); prajananam—as a son; prabhuh—the King.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the process of fruitive yajna became manifest within his heart, King Pururava went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthali.</p>
<p>There he saw that from the womb of a sami tree, an asvattha tree had grown.</p>
<p>He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two aranis.</p>
<p>Desiring to go to the planet where Urvasi resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son.</p>
<p>In this way he began to ignite a fire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Vedic fire for performing yajna was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices.</p>
<p>Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the aranis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third.</p>
<p>Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajna.</p>
<p>If successful, a yajna will fulfill the desire of its performer.</p>
<p>Thus Pururava took advantage of the process of yajna to fulfill his lusty desires.</p>
<p>He thought of the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son.</p>
<p>A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura is sami-garbhad agnim mantha.</p>
<p>A similar mantra is urvasyam urasi pururavah.</p>
<p>Pururava wanted to have children continuously by the womb of Urvasi.</p>
<p>His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvasi and thereby get a son.</p>
<p>In other words, he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing yajna he thought of Urvasi, instead of thinking of the master of yajna, Yajnesvara, Lord Visnu.</p>

<p>tasya nirmanthanaj jato</p>
<p>jata-veda vibhavasuh</p>
<p>trayya sa vidyaya rajna</p>
<p>putratve kalpitas tri-vrt</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasya—of Pururava; nirmanthanat—because of interaction; jatah—was born; jata-vedah—meant for material enjoyment according to the Vedic principles; vibhavasuh—a fire; trayya—following the Vedic principles; sah—the fire; vidyaya—by such a process; rajna—by the King; putratve—a son’s being born; kalpitah—it so became; tri-vrt—the three letters a-u-m combined together as om.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From Pururava’s rubbing of the aranis came a fire.</p>
<p>By such a fire one can achieve all success in material enjoyment and be purified in seminal birth, initiation and in the performance of sacrifice, which are invoked with the combined letters a-u-m.</p>
<p>Thus the fire was considered the son of King Pururava.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (sukra), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (savitra), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (yajna).</p>
<p>Thus when Maharaja Pururava generated the fire by rubbing the aranis, the fire became his son.</p>
<p>Either by semen, by initiation or by yajna one may get a son.</p>
<p>The Vedic mantra omkara, or pranava, consisting of the letters a-u-m, can call each of these three methods into existence.</p>
<p>Therefore the words nirmanthanaj jatah indicate that by the rubbing of the aranis a son was born.</p>

<p>tenayajata yajnesam</p>
<p>bhagavantam adhoksajam</p>
<p>urvasi-lokam anvicchan</p>
<p>sarva-devamayam harim</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tena—by generating such a fire; ayajata—he worshiped; yajna-isam—the master or enjoyer of the yajna; bhagavantam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhoksajam—beyond the perception of the senses; urvasi-lokam—to the planet where Urvasi was staying; anvicchan—although desiring to go; sarva-deva-mayam—the reservoir of all demigods; harim—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By means of that fire, Pururava, who desired to go to the planet where Urvasi resided, performed a sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of all the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: (Bg.5.29) any loka, or planet, to which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the performance of sacrifice.</p>
<p>The purpose of yajna is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In this age, as we have explained many times, the yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material or spiritual.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita (3.14) also says, yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by offering sacrifices to Lord Visnu, one can have sufficient rainfall.</p>
<p>When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce everything (sama-kama-dugha mahi).</p>
<p>If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables.</p>
<p>Everything one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, sarva-kama-dugha mahi (Bhag.1.10.4).</p>
<p>Everything is possible by performing yajna.</p>
<p>Therefore although Pururava desired something material, he factually performed yajna to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord is adhoksaja, beyond the perception of Pururava and everyone else.</p>
<p>Consequently, some kind of yajna must be performed to fulfill the desires of the living entity.</p>
<p>Yajnas can be performed in human society only when society is divided by varnasrama-dharma into four varnas and four asramas.</p>
<p>Without such a regulative process, no one can perform yajnas, and without the performance of yajnas, no material plans can make human society happy at any time.</p>
<p>Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yajnas.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, the yajna recommended is sankirtana, the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society.</p>



<p><strong>9.14.48</strong></p>
<p>eka eva pura vedah</p>
<p>pranavah sarva-vanmayah</p>
<p>devo narayano nanya</p>
<p>eko ’gnir varna eva ca</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ekah—only one; eva—indeed; pura—formerly; vedah—book of transcendental knowledge; pranavah—omkara; sarva-vak-mayah—consisting of all Vedic mantras; devah—the Lord, God; narayanah—only Narayana (was worshipable in the Satya-yuga); na anyah—no other; ekah agnih—one division only for agni; varnah—order of life; eva ca—and certainly.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included in one mantra—pranava, the root of all Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana was the only worshipable Deity; there was no recommendation for worship of the demigods.</p>
<p>Fire was one only, and the only order of life in human society was known as hamsa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four.</p>
<p>Later, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda, the Atharva Veda (or, some say, the Yajur Veda), was divided into four—Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva—for the facility of human society.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga the only mantra was omkara (om tat sat).</p>
<p>The same name omkara is manifest in the mantra Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>Unless one is a brahmana, one cannot utter omkara and get the desired result.</p>
<p>But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a sudra, unfit for pronouncing the pranava, omkara.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastras have recommended the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>Omkara is a mantra, or maha-mantra, and Hare Krsna is also a maha-mantra.</p>
<p>The purpose of pronouncing omkara is to address the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya).</p>
<p>And the purpose of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra is the same.</p>
<p>Hare: O energy of the Lord Krsna: O Lord Krsna Hare: O energy of the Lord Rama: O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer The only worshipable Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>By worshiping the demigods, one worships the different parts of the Lord, just as one might water the branches and twigs of a tree.</p>
<p>But worshiping Narayana, the all-inclusive Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like pouring water on the root of the tree, thus supplying water to the trunk, branches, twigs, leaves and so on.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga people knew how to fulfill the necessities of life simply by worshiping Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The same purpose can be served in this age of Kali by the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, as recommended in the Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>pururavasa evasit</p>
<p>trayi treta-mukhe nrpa</p>
<p>agnina prajaya raja</p>
<p>lokam gandharvam eyivan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>pururavasah—from King Pururava; eva—thus; asit—there was; trayi—the Vedic principles of karma, jnana and upasana; treta-mukhe—in the beginning of the Treta-yuga; nrpa—O King Pariksit; agnina—simply by generating the fire of sacrifice; prajaya—by his son; raja—King Pururava; lokam—to the planet; gandharvam—of the Gandharvas; eyivan—achieved.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Maharaja Pariksit, at the beginning of Treta-yuga, King Pururava inaugurated a karma-kanda sacrifice.</p>
<p>Thus Pururava, who considered the yajnic fire his son, was able to go to Gandharvaloka as he desired.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Satya-yuga, Lord Narayana was worshiped by meditation (krte yad dhyayato visnum).</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Visnu, Narayana, and achieved every success by this process of meditation.</p>
<p>In the next yuga, Treta-yuga, the performance of yajna began (tretayam yajato mukhaih).</p>
<p>Therefore this verse says, trayi treta-mukhe.</p>
<p>Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that in Treta-yuga, beginning in the Svayambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.</p>
