<h1>Lord Parasurama Destroys the World’s Ruling Class</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.16</strong></p>
<p>When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described in this chapter, Parasurama rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.</p>
<p>This chapter also describes the descendants of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>When Jamadagni’s wife, Renuka, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaras, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him.</p>
<p>Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband.</p>
<p>Parasurama killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived.</p>
<p>The sons of Kartaviryarjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord Parasurama, and therefore when Parasurama was absent from the asrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Parasurama returned to the asrama and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determination to kill all the ksatriyas on the surface of the world.</p>
<p>Taking up his axe, he went to Mahismati-pura, the capital of Kartaviryarjuna, and killed all of Kartaviryarjuna’s sons, whose blood became a great river.</p>
<p>Parasurama, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kartaviryarjuna; later, when the ksatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no ksatriyas on the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Parasurama joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to the higher planeary system known as Saptarsi-mandala.</p>
<p>Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata.</p>
<p>In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Gadhi, the most powerful Visvamitra took birth.</p>
<p>By dint of his austerity and penance, he became a brahmana.</p>
<p>He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandas.</p>
<p>In the sacrificial arena of Hariscandra, the son of Ajigarta named Sunahsepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Prajapatis he was released.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he became Devarata in the dynasty of Gadhi.</p>
<p>The fifty elder sons of Visvamitra, however, did not accept Sunahsepha as their elder brother, and therefore Visvamitra cursed them to become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization.</p>
<p>Visvamitra’s fifty-first son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Visvamitra, being satisfied, blessed them.</p>
<p>Thus Devarata was accepted in the dynasty of Kausika, and consequently there are different divisions of that dynasty.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Jamadagni was certainly very powerful due to his austerities, but because of a slight offense by his poor wife, Renuka, he ordered that she be killed.</p>
<p>This certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described herein.</p>
<p>Lord Parasurama was also infected by sin because of killing Kartaviryarjuna, although this was not very offensive.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether one be Kartaviryarjuna, Lord Parasurama, Jamadagni or whoever one may be, one must act very cautiously and sagaciously; otherwise one must suffer the results of sinful activities.</p>
<p>This is the lesson we receive from Vedic literature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Parasurama created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture.</p>
<p>Because the ksatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Parasurama, on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the ksatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pancaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Parasurama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his eternal mission is paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)—to protect the devotees and annihilate the miscreants.</p>
<p>To kill all the sinful men is one among the tasks of the incarnation of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Parasurama killed all the ksatriyas twenty-one times consecutively because they were disobedient to the brahminical culture.</p>
<p>That the ksatriyas had killed his father was only a plea; the real fact is that because the ksatriyas, the ruling class, had become polluted, their position was inauspicious.</p>
<p>Brahminical culture is enjoined in the sastra, especially in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>According to the laws of nature, whether at the time of Parasurama or at the present, if the government becomes irresponsible and sinful, not caring for brahminical culture, there will certainly be an incarnation of God like Parasurama to create a devastation by fire, famine, pestilence or some other calamity.</p>
<p>Whenever the government disrespects the supremacy of the personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of varnasrama-dharma, it will certainly have to face such catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Parasurama.</p>

<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world Karma-bandhanah refers to the repeated acceptance of one material body after another.</p>
<p>The whole problem of life is this repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Therefore one is advised to work to perform yajna meant for satisfying Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Although Lord Parasurama was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he had to account for sinful activities.</p>
<p>Anyone in this material world, however careful he may be, must commit some sinful activities, even though he does not want to.</p>
<p>For example, one may trample many small ants and other insects while walking on the street and kill many living beings unknowingly.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic principle of panca-yajna, five kinds of recommended sacrifice, is compulsory.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, however, there is a great concession given to people in general.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: (SB 11.5.32) we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam: although He is Krsna Himself, He always chants Hare Krsna and preaches Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One is recommended to worship this incarnation by chanting, the sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>The performance of sankirtana-yajna is a special concession for human society to save people from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities.</p>
<p>We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that one take to Krsna consciousness and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The seven stars revolving around the polestar at the zenith are called saptarsi-mandala.</p>
<p>On these seven stars, which form the topmost part of our planeary system, reside seven sages: Kasyapa, Atri, Vasistha, Visvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni and Bharadvaja.</p>
<p>These seven stars are seen every night, and they each make a complete orbit around the polestar within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Along with these seven stars, all the others stars also orbit from east to west.</p>
<p>The upper portion of the universe is called the north, and the lower portion is called the south.</p>
<p>Even in our ordinary dealings, while studying a map, we regard the upper portion of the map as north.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>gadheh—from Maharaja Gadhi; abhut—was born; maha-tejah—very powerful; samiddhah—inflamed; iva—like; pavakah—fire; tapasa—by austerities and penances; ksatram—the position of a ksatriya; utsrjya—giving up; yah—one who (Visvamitra); lebhe—achieved; brahma-varcasam—the quality of a brahmana.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Visvamitra, the son of Maharaja Gadhi, was as powerful as the flames of fire.</p>
<p>From the position of a ksatriya, he achieved the position of a powerful brahmana by undergoing penances and austerities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Now, having narrated the history of Lord Parasurama, Sukadeva Gosvami begins the history of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>From the history of Parasurama we can understand that although Parasurama belonged to the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Later, after finishing his work as a ksatriya, he again became a brahmana and returned to Mahendra-parvata.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can see that although Visvamitra was born in a ksatriya family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a brahmana.</p>
<p>These histories confirm the statements in sastra that a brahmana may become a ksatriya, a ksatriya may become a brahmana or vaisya, and a vaisya may become a brahmana, by achieving the required qualities.</p>
<p>One’s status does not depend upon birth.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.11.35) by Narada:</p>
<p>yasya yal laksanam proktam</p>
<p>pumso varnabhivyanjakam</p>
<p>yad anyatrapi drsyeta</p>
<p>tat tenaiva vinirdiset</p>
<p>If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification To know who is a brahmana and who is a ksatriya, one must consider a man’s quality and work.</p>
<p>If all the unqualified sudras become so-called brahmanas and ksatriyas, social order will be impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish.</p>

<p>In relation to him, all the other sons were celebrated as the Madhucchandas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this connection, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes this statement from the Vedas: tasya ha visvamitrasyaika-satam putra asuh pancasad eva jyayamso madhucchandasah pancasat kaniyamsah Visvamitra had 101 sons.</p>
<p>Fifty were older than Madhucchanda and fifty younger</p>

<p>Visvamitra ordered his other sons to accept Sunahsepha as their eldest brother.</p>

<p>Sunahsepha’s father sold Sunahsepha to be sacrificed as a man-animal in the yajna of King Hariscandra.</p>
<p>When Sunahsepha was brought into the sacrificial arena, he prayed to the demigods for release and was released by their mercy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is a description of Sunahsepha.</p>
<p>When Hariscandra was to sacrifice his son Rohita, Rohita arranged to save his own life by purchasing Sunahsepha from Sunahsepha’s father to be sacrificed in the yajna.</p>
<p>Sunahsepha was sold to Maharaja Hariscandra because he was the middle son, between the oldest and the youngest.</p>
<p>It appears that the sacrifice of a man as an animal in yajna has been practiced for a very long time.</p>



<p><strong>9.16.32</strong></p>
<p>yo rato deva-yajane</p>
<p>devair gadhisu tapasah</p>
<p>deva-rata iti khyatah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although Sunahsepha was born in the Bhargava dynasty, he was greatly advanced in spiritual life, and therefore the demigods involved in the sacrifice protected him.</p>
<p>Consequently he was also celebrated as the descendant of Gadhi named Devarata.</p>



<p><strong>9.16.33</strong></p>
<p>ye madhucchandaso jyesthah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When requested by their father to accept Sunahsepha as the eldest son, the elder fifty of the Madhucchandas, the sons of Visvamitra, did not agree.</p>
<p>Therefore Visvamitra, being angry, cursed them May all of you bad sons become mlecchas he said, being opposed to the principles of Vedic culture</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Vedic literature there are names like mleccha and yavana.</p>
<p>The mlecchas are understood to be those who do not follow the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>In former days, the mlecchas were fewer, and Visvamitra Muni cursed his sons to become mlecchas.</p>
<p>But in the present age, Kali-yuga, there is no need of cursing, for people are automatically mlecchas.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but at the end of Kali-yuga the entire population will consist of mlecchas because no one will follow the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>At that time the incarnation Kalki will appear.</p>
<p>Mleccha-nivaha-nidhane kalayasi kara-balam.</p>
<p>He will kill all the mlecchas indiscriminately with his sword.</p>



<p><strong>9.16.34</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the elder Madhucchandas were cursed, the younger fifty, along with Madhucchanda himself, approached their father and agreed to accept his proposal.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus the younger Madhucchandas accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother and told him, We shall follow your orders Visvamitra then said to his obedient sons, Because you have accepted Sunahsepha as your eldest brother, I am very satisfied.</p>
<p>By accepting my order, you have made me a father of worthy sons, and therefore I bless all of you to become the fathers of sons also</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Of the one hundred sons, half disobeyed Visvamitra by not accepting Sunahsepha as their eldest brother, but the other half accepted his order.</p>
<p>Therefore the father blessed the obedient sons to become the fathers of sons.</p>
<p>Otherwise they too would have been cursed to be sonless mlecchas.</p>

<p>Visvamitra said, O Kusikas (descendants of Kausika), this Devarata is my son and is one of you.</p>
<p>Please obey his orders O King Pariksit, Visvamitra had many other sons, such as Astaka, Harita, Jaya and Kratuman.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Visvamitra cursed some of his sons and blessed the others, and he also adopted a son.</p>
<p>Thus there were varieties in the Kausika dynasty, but among all the sons, Devarata was considered the eldest.</p>
