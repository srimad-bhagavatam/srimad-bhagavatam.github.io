<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#916" id="916">9.16</a></strong></p>
<p>When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described in this chapter, Parasurama rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.</p>
<p>This chapter also describes the descendants of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>When Jamadagni’s wife, Renuka, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaras, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him.</p>
<p>Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband.</p>
<p>Parasurama killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived.</p>
<p>The sons of Kartaviryarjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord Parasurama, and therefore when Parasurama was absent from the asrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Parasurama returned to the asrama and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determination to kill all the ksatriyas on the surface of the world.</p>
<p>Taking up his axe, he went to Mahismati-pura, the capital of Kartaviryarjuna, and killed all of Kartaviryarjuna’s sons, whose blood became a great river.</p>
<p>Parasurama, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kartaviryarjuna; later, when the ksatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no ksatriyas on the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Parasurama joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptarsi-mandala.</p>
<p>Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata.</p>
<p>In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Gadhi, the most powerful Visvamitra took birth.</p>
<p>By dint of his austerity and penance, he became a brahmana.</p>
<p>He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandas.</p>
<p>In the sacrificial arena of Hariscandra, the son of Ajigarta named Sunahsepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Prajapatis he was released.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he became Devarata in the dynasty of Gadhi.</p>
<p>The fifty elder sons of Visvamitra, however, did not accept Sunahsepha as their elder brother, and therefore Visvamitra cursed them to become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization.</p>
<p>Visvamitra’s fifty-first son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Visvamitra, being satisfied, blessed them.</p>
<p>Thus Devarata was accepted in the dynasty of Kausika, and consequently there are different divisions of that dynasty.</p>
