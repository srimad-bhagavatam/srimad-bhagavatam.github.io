<h1><a class="header" href="#king-yayati-achieves-liberation" id="king-yayati-achieves-liberation">King Yayati Achieves Liberation</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#919" id="919">9.19</a></strong></p>
<p>This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Maharaja Yayati achieved liberation after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.</p>
<p>After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yayati finally became disgusted with such materialistic happiness.</p>
<p>When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved Devayani.</p>
<p>The story is as follows.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat.</p>
<p>He became attracted to this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united.</p>
<p>One day thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brahmana owner, to whom she described her husband’s behavior.</p>
<p>The brahmana became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brahmana’s pardon and was given back the power for sex.</p>
<p>Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied.</p>
<p>If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one’s lusty desires.</p>
<p>These desires are like a fire.</p>
<p>One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished.</p>
<p>To extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process.</p>
<p>The sastra therefore advises that by intelligence one renounce the life of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned man.</p>
<p>King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons.</p>
<p>He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyasi, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus he attained perfection.</p>
<p>Later, when his beloved wife, Devayani, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
