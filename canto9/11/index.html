<h1>Lord Ramacandra Rules the World</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.11</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra resided in Ayodhya with His younger brothers and performed various sacrifices.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various sacrifices by which to worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He gave land to the hota, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma priests.</p>
<p>He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance He gave to the acarya.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s faith in the brahmanas and affection for His servants was observed by all the brahmanas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him.</p>
<p>They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their hearts as a sufficient contribution.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him.</p>
<p>By chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man’s house.</p>
<p>In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of Sitadevi.</p>
<p>The Lord immediately returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sitadevi’s company.</p>
<p>Thus He banished Sitadevi, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Valmiki Muni, where she gave birth to twin sons, named Lava and Kusa.</p>
<p>In Ayodhya, Laksmana begot two sons named Angada and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named Taksa and Puskala, and Satrughna begot two sons named Subahu and Srutasena.</p>
<p>When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Ramacandra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas.</p>
<p>By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought home.</p>
<p>Satrughna killed a demon named Lavana at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of Mathura.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sitadevi placed her two sons in the care of Valmiki Muni and then entered into the earth.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of this, Lord Ramacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices for thirteen thousand years.</p>
<p>After describing the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra’s disappearance and establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Ramacandra and by describing how the Lord protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.</p>
<p><strong>9.11.1</strong></p>
<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>bhagavan atmanatmanam</p>
<p>rama uttama-kalpakaih</p>
<p>sarva-devamayam devam</p>
<p>ije ’thacaryavan makhaih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; atmana—by Himself; atmanam—Himself; ramah—Lord Ramacandra; uttama-kalpakaih—with very opulent paraphernalia; sarva-deva-mayam—the heart and soul of all the demigods; devam—the Supreme Lord Himself; ije—worshiped; atha—thus; acaryavan—under the guidance of an acarya; makhaih—by performing sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thereafter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ramacandra, accepted an acarya and performed sacrifices (yajnas) with opulent paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Thus He Himself worshiped Himself, for He is the Supreme Lord of all demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sarvarhanam acyutejya.</p>
<p>If Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshiped, then everyone is worshiped.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.31.14):</p>
<p>yatha taror mula-nisecanena</p>
<p>trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah</p>
<p>pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam</p>
<p>tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya</p>
<p>As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches, twigs and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality Performing yajna involves worshiping the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, bhagavan atmanatmanam ije: the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself.</p>
<p>This does not, of course, justify the Mayavada philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The jiva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The living entities (vibhinnamsa) never become one with the Lord, although Mayavadis sometimes imitate the Lord’s worship of Himself.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna meditated upon Himself every morning as a grhastha, and similarly Lord Ramacandra performed yajnas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of ahangraha-upasana.</p>
<p>Such unauthorized worship is not recommended herein.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra gave the entire east to the hota priest, the entire south to the brahma priest, the west to the adhvaryu priest, and the north to the udgata priest, the reciter of the Sama Veda.</p>
<p>In this way, He donated His kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>9.11.5</strong></p>
<p>te tu brahmana-devasya</p>
<p>vatsalyam viksya samstutam</p>
<p>pritah klinna-dhiyas tasmai</p>
<p>pratyarpyedam babhasire</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All the brahmanas who were engaged in the various activities of the sacrifice were very pleased with Lord Ramacandra, who was greatly affectionate and favorable to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Thus with melted hearts they returned all the property received from Him and spoke as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapter it was said that the prajas, the citizens, strictly followed the system of varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>The brahmanas acted exactly like brahmanas, the ksatriyas exactly like ksatriyas, and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Lord Ramacandra gave everything in charity to the brahmanas, the brahmanas, being qualified, wisely considered that brahmanas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it.</p>
<p>The qualifications of a brahmana are given in Bhagavad-gita (18.42): samo damas tapah saucam</p>
<p>ksantir arjavam eva ca</p>
<p>jnanam vijnanam astikyam</p>
<p>brahma-karma svabhavajam</p>
<p>Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the brahmanas did not refuse Lord Ramacandra’s gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King.</p>
<p>The brahmanas were so pleased with Lord Ramacandra’s affection toward them that their hearts melted.</p>
<p>They saw that Lord Ramacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a ksatriya and was exemplary in character.</p>
<p>One of the qualifications of a ksatriya is to be charitable.</p>
<p>A ksatriya, or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases.</p>
<p>Danam isvara-bhavah.</p>
<p>On one hand, ksatriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Yudhisthira gave charity, he engaged Karna to take charge of distributing it.</p>
<p>Karna was very famous as Data Karna.</p>
<p>The word data refers to one who gives charity very liberally.</p>
<p>The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity.</p>
<p>A ksatriya’s duty is to give charity, and a brahmana’s duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the brahmanas were given so much land by Lord Ramacandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy.</p>



<p><strong>9.11.6</strong></p>
<p>aprattam nas tvaya kim nu</p>
<p>bhagavan bhuvanesvara</p>
<p>yan no ’ntar-hrdayam visya</p>
<p>tamo hamsi sva-rocisa</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aprattam—not given; nah—unto us; tvaya—by Your Lordship; kim—what; nu—indeed; bhagavan—O Supreme Lord; bhuvana-isvara—O master of the whole universe; yat—because; nah—our; antah-hrdayam—within the core of the heart; visya—entering; tamah—the darkness of ignorance; hamsi—You annihilate; sva-rocisa—by Your own effulgence.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Lord, You are the master of the entire universe.</p>
<p>What have You not given to us? You have entered the core of our hearts and dissipated the darkness of our ignorance by Your effulgence.</p>
<p>This is the supreme gift.</p>
<p>We do not need a material donation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Dhruva Maharaja was offered a benediction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he replied, O my Lord, I am fully satisfied.</p>
<p>I do not need any material benediction Similarly, when Prahlada Maharaja was offered a benediction by Lord Nrsimhadeva, he also refused to accept it and instead declared that a devotee should not be like a vanik, a mercantile man who gives something in exchange for some profit.</p>
<p>One who becomes a devotee for some material profit is not a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Brahmanas are always enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>And because the brahmanas and Vaisnavas are always directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not greedy for material wealth.</p>
<p>What is absolutely necessary they possess, but they do not want an expanded kingdom.</p>
<p>An example of this was given by Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Acting as a brahmacari, Lord Vamanadeva wanted only three paces of land.</p>
<p>Aspiring to possess more and more for personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance is conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a brahmana or Vaisnava.</p>



<p><strong>9.11.7</strong></p>

<p>You are the chief of all famous persons within this world, and Your lotus feet are worshiped by sages who are beyond the jurisdiction of punishment.</p>

<p>(Speaking to his unchaste wife, the man said)</p>
<p>You go to another man’s house, and therefore you are unchaste and polluted.</p>
<p>I shall not maintain you any more.</p>
<p>A henpecked husband like Lord Rama may accept a wife like Sita, who went to another man’s house, but I am not henpecked like Him, and therefore I shall not accept you again.</p>



<p><strong>9.11.10</strong></p>
<p>iti lokad bahu-mukhad</p>

<p>Fearing such rascals, Lord Ramacandra abandoned His wife, Sitadevi, although she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Thus Sitadevi went to the asrama of Valmiki Muni.</p>

<p>Satrughna also killed a Raksasa named Lavana, who was the son of Madhu Raksasa.</p>
<p>Thus He established in the great forest known as Madhuvana the town known as Mathura.</p>



<p><strong>9.11.15</strong></p>

<p><strong>9.11.16</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After hearing the news of mother Sita’s entering the earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was certainly aggrieved.</p>
<p>Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, upon remembering the exalted qualities of mother Sita, He could not check His grief in transcendental love.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s grief at the news of Sitadevi’s entering the earth is not to be considered material.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world also there are feelings of separation, but such feelings are considered spiritual bliss.</p>
<p>Grief in separation exists even in the Absolute, but such feelings of separation in the spiritual world are transcendentally blissful.</p>
<p>Such feelings are a sign of tasya prema-vasyatva-svabhava, being under the influence of hladini-sakti and being controlled by love.</p>
<p>In the material world such feelings of separation are only a perverted reflection.</p>



<p><strong>9.11.17</strong></p>
<p>stri-pum-prasanga etadrk</p>
<p>sarvatra trasam-avahah</p>
<p>apisvaranam kim uta</p>
<p>gramyasya grha-cetasah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>stri-pum-prasangah—attraction between husband and wife, or man and woman; etadrk—like this; sarvatra—everywhere; trasam-avahah—the cause of fear; api—even; isvaranam—of controllers; kim uta—and what to speak of; gramyasya—of ordinary men of this material world; grha-cetasah—who are attached to materialistic household life.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The attraction between man and woman, or male and female, always exists everywhere, making everyone always fearful.</p>
<p>Such feelings are present even among the controllers like Brahma and Lord Siva and is the cause of fear for them, what to speak of others who are attached to household life in this material world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As explained above, when the feelings of love and transcendental bliss from the spiritual world are pervertedly reflected in this material world, they are certainly the cause of bondage.</p>
<p>As long as men feel attracted to women in this material world and women feel attracted to men, the bondage of repeated birth and death will continue.</p>
<p>But in the spiritual world, where there is no fear of birth and death, such feelings of separation are the cause of transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>In the absolute reality there are varieties of feeling, but all of them are of the same quality of transcendental bliss.</p>



<p><strong>9.11.18</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After completing the sacrifice, Lord Ramacandra, whose lotus feet were sometimes pierced by thorns when He lived in Dandakaranya, placed those lotus feet in the hearts of those who always think of Him.</p>
<p>Then He entered His own abode, the Vaikuntha plane beyond the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation for devotees.</p>
<p>Sometimes when Lord Ramacandra wandered in the forest of Dandakaranya, thorns pricked His lotus feet.</p>
<p>The devotees, upon thinking of this, would faint.</p>
<p>The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or reaction of this material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the pricking of the Lord’s lotus feet by a thorn.</p>
<p>This was the attitude of the gopis when they thought of Krsna wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains of sand pricking His lotus feet.</p>
<p>This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karmis, jnanis or yogis.</p>
<p>The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord’s lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord’s disappearance, for the Lord had to return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.</p>
<p>The word atma-jyotih is significant.</p>
<p>The brahmajyoti, which is greatly appreciated by jnanis, or monistic philosophers who desire to enter it for liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord’s body yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-</p>
<p>kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam</p>
<p>tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power.</p>
<p>The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planes, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes (Brahma-samhita5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuntha planes.</p>
<p>In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuntha planes, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun.</p>
<p>To enter the sun plane, one must go through the sunshine.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuntha planes, they go through the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>The jnanis, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the Vaikuntha planes, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>Thus after some time they fall again to this material world.</p>
<p>Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho ’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah (Bhag.10.2.32).</p>
<p>The Vaikuntha planes are covered by the brahmajyoti, and therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaikuntha planes are unless one is a pure devotee.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; idam—all these; yasah—fame; raghu-pateh—of Lord Ramacandra; sura-yacnaya—by the prayers of the demigods; atta-lila-tanoh—whose spiritual body is always engaged in various pastimes; adhika-samya-vimukta-dhamnah—no one is greater than or equal to Him; raksah-vadhah—killing the Raksasa (Ravana); jaladhi-bandhanam—bridging the ocean; astra-pugaih—with bow and arrows; kim—whether; tasya—His; satru-hanane—in killing the enemies; kapayah—the monkeys; sahayah—assistants.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s reputation for having killed Ravana with showers of arrows at the request of the demigods and for having built a bridge over the ocean does not constitute the factual glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra, whose spiritual body is always engaged in various pastimes.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra has no equal or superior, and therefore He had no need to take help from the monkeys to gain victory over Ravana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad6.8):</p>
<p>na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate</p>
<p>na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate</p>
<p>parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate</p>
<p>svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to or greater than Him, for everything is done naturally and systematically by His multifarious energies The Lord has nothing to do (na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate); whatever He does is His pastime.</p>
<p>The Lord has no duty to perform to oblige anyone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, He appears to act to protect His devotees or kill His enemies.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can be the Lord’s enemy, since who could be more powerful than the Lord? There is actually no question of anyone’s being His enemy, but when the Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes down to this material world and acts like a human being, thus showing His wonderful, glorious activities to please the devotees.</p>
<p>His devotees always want to see the Lord victorious in varied activities, and therefore, to please Himself and them, the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform wonderful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s spotless name and fame, which vanquish all sinful reactions, are celebrated in all directions, like the ornamental cloth of the victorious elephant that conquers all directions.</p>
<p>Great saintly persons like Markandeya Rsi still glorify His characteristics in the assemblies of great emperors like Maharaja Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the saintly kings and all the demigods, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, worship the Lord by bowing down with their helmets.</p>
<p>Let me offer my obeisances unto His lotus feet.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—He, Lord Ramacandra; yaih—by which persons; sprstah—touched; abhidrstah—seen; va—either; samvistah—eating together, lying together; anugatah—followed as servants; api va—even; kosalah—all those inhabitants of Kosala; te—they; yayuh—departed; sthanam—to the place; yatra—wherein; gacchanti—they go; yoginah—all the bhakti-yogis.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra returned to His abode, to which bhakti-yogis are promoted.</p>
<p>This is the place to which all the inhabitants of Ayodhya went after they served the Lord in His manifest pastimes by offering Him obeisances, touching His lotus feet, fully observing Him as a fatherlike King, sitting or lying down with Him like equals, or even just accompanying Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna Here this is confirmed.</p>
<p>All the inhabitants of Ayodhya who saw Lord Ramacandra as citizens, served Him as servants, sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present during His reign went back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>After giving up the body, the devotee who becomes perfect in devotional service enters that particular universe where Lord Ramacandra or Lord Krsna is engaged in His pastimes.</p>
<p>Then, after being trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that prakata-lila, the devotee is finally promoted to sanatana-dhama, the supreme abode in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>This sanatana-dhama is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (paras tasmat tu bhavo ’nyo’vyakto’vyaktat sanatanah (Bg.8.20)).</p>
<p>One who enters the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is called nitya-lila-pravista.</p>
<p>To understand clearly why Lord Ramacandra returned, it is mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the bhakti-yogis go.</p>
<p>The impersonalists misunderstand the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam to mean that the Lord entered His own effulgence and therefore become impersonal.</p>
<p>But the Lord is a person, and His devotees are persons.</p>
<p>Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were persons in the past, they are persons in the present, and they will continue to be persons even after giving up the body.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>purusah—any person; rama-caritam—the narration concerning the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra; sravanaih—by aural reception; upadharayan—simply by this process of hearing; anrsamsya-parah—becomes completely free from envy; rajan—O King Pariksit; karma-bandhaih—by the bondage of fruitive activities; vimucyate—one becomes liberated.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, anyone who aurally receives the narrations concerning the characteristics of Lord Ramacandra’s pastimes will ultimately be freed from the disease of envy and thus be liberated from the bondage of fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here in this material world, everyone is envious of someone else.</p>
<p>Even in religious life, it is sometimes found that if one devotee has advanced in spiritual activities, other devotees are envious of him.</p>
<p>Such envious devotees are not completely freed from the bondage of birth and death.</p>
<p>As long as one is not completely free from the cause of birth and death, one cannot enter the sanatana-dhama or the eternal pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p>One becomes envious because of being influenced by the designations of the body, but the liberated devotee has nothing to do with the body, and therefore he is completely on the transcendental platform.</p>
<p>A devotee is never envious of anyone, even his enemy.</p>
<p>Because the devotee knows that the Lord is his supreme protector, he thinks, What harm can the so-called enemy do Thus a devotee is confident about his protection.</p>
<p>The Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: (Bg.4.11) According to the proportion of one’s surrender unto Me, I respond accordingly A devotee must therefore be completely free from envy, especially of other devotees.</p>
<p>To envy other devotees is a great offense, a vaisnava-aparadha.</p>
<p>A devotee who constantly engages in hearing and chanting (sravana-kirtana) is certainly freed from the disease of envy, and thus he becomes eligible to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami replied: After accepting the throne of the government by the fervent request of His younger brother Bharata, Lord Ramacandra ordered His younger brothers to go out and conquer the entire world, while He personally remained in the capital to give audience to all the citizens and residents of the palace and supervise the governmental affairs with His other assistants.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devotees or assistants to be engaged in sense gratification.</p>
<p>The younger brothers of Lord Ramacandra were at home enjoying the personal presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them to go out and achieve victory all over the world.</p>
<p>It was the custom (and this custom, in some places, is still current) that all other kings would have to accept the supremacy of the emperor.</p>
<p>If the king of a small state did not accept the emperor’s supremacy, there would be a fight, and the king of the small state would be obliged to accept the emperor as supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the emperor to rule the country.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them to go out.</p>
<p>Many of the Lord’s devotees residing in Vrndavana have taken the vow not to leave Vrndavana to preach Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>But the Lord says that Krsna consciousness should be spread all over the world, in every village and every town.</p>
<p>This is the open order of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama</p>
<p>sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama</p>
<p>A pure devotee, therefore, must execute the order of the Lord and must not gratify his senses by remaining stagnant in one place, falsely proud, thinking that because he does not leave Vrndavana but chants in a solitary place he has become a great devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee must carry out the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa (Cc.Madhya 7.128).</p>
<p>Every devotee, therefore, should spread Krsna consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he meets to accept the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me This is the order of the Lord, who speaks as the supreme emperor.</p>
<p>Everyone should be induced to accept this order, for this is victory (dig-vijaya).</p>
<p>And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to impress upon everyone this philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Of course, those who are kanistha-adhikaris do not preach, but the Lord shows mercy to them also, as He did by staying personally in Ayodhya to give audience to the people in general.</p>
<p>One should not mistakenly think that the Lord asked His younger brothers to leave Ayodhya because He especially favored the citizens.</p>
<p>The Lord is merciful to everyone, and He knows how to show His favor to each individual person according to his capacity.</p>
<p>One who abides by the order of the Lord is a pure devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>During the reign of Lord Ramacandra, the streets of the capital, Ayodhya, were sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, thrown about by elephants from their trunks.</p>
<p>When the citizens saw the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the city in such opulence, they appreciated this opulence very much.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We have simply heard about the opulence of Rama-rajya during the reign of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>Now, here is one example of the opulence of the Lord’s kingdom.</p>
<p>The streets of Ayodhya were not only cleaned but also sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, which were distributed by elephants through their trunks.</p>
<p>There was no need of sprinkling machines, for the elephant has a natural ability to suck water through its trunk and again throw it out in a shower.</p>
<p>We can understand the opulence of the city from this one example: it was actually sprinkled with perfumed water.</p>
<p>Moreover, the citizens had the opportunity to see the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the state.</p>
<p>He was not a sleeping monarch, as we can understand from His activities in sending His brothers to see to affairs outside the capital and punish anyone who did not obey the emperor’s orders.</p>
<p>This is called dig-vijaya.</p>
<p>The citizens were all given facilities for peaceful life, and they were also qualified with appropriate attributes according to varnasrama.</p>
<p>As we have seen from the previous chapter, varnasrama-gunanvitah: the citizens were trained according to the varnasrama system.</p>
<p>A class of men were brahmanas, a class of men were ksatriyas, a class were vaisyas, and a class were sudras.</p>
<p>Without this scientific division, there can be no question of good citizenship.</p>
<p>The King, being magnanimous and perfect in His duty, performed many sacrifices and treated the citizens as His sons, and the citizens, being trained in the varnasrama system, were obedient and perfectly ordered.</p>
<p>The entire monarchy was so opulent and peaceful that the government was even able to sprinkle the street with perfumed water, what to speak of other management.</p>
<p>Since the city was sprinkled with perfumed water, we can simply imagine how opulent it was in other respects.</p>
<p>Why should the citizens not have felt happy during the reign of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
