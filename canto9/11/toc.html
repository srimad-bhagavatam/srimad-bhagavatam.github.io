<h1><a class="header" href="#lord-ramacandra-rules-the-world" id="lord-ramacandra-rules-the-world">Lord Ramacandra Rules the World</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#911" id="911">9.11</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra resided in Ayodhya with His younger brothers and performed various sacrifices.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various sacrifices by which to worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He gave land to the hota, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma priests.</p>
<p>He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance He gave to the acarya.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s faith in the brahmanas and affection for His servants was observed by all the brahmanas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him.</p>
<p>They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their hearts as a sufficient contribution.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him.</p>
<p>By chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man’s house.</p>
<p>In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of Sitadevi.</p>
<p>The Lord immediately returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sitadevi’s company.</p>
<p>Thus He banished Sitadevi, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Valmiki Muni, where she gave birth to twin sons, named Lava and Kusa.</p>
<p>In Ayodhya, Laksmana begot two sons named Angada and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named Taksa and Puskala, and Satrughna begot two sons named Subahu and Srutasena.</p>
<p>When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Ramacandra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas.</p>
<p>By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought home.</p>
<p>Satrughna killed a demon named Lavana at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of Mathura.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sitadevi placed her two sons in the care of Valmiki Muni and then entered into the earth.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of this, Lord Ramacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices for thirteen thousand years.</p>
<p>After describing the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra’s disappearance and establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Ramacandra and by describing how the Lord protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.</p>

<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>bhagavan atmanatmanam</p>
<p>rama uttama-kalpakaih</p>
<p>sarva-devamayam devam</p>
<p>ije ’thacaryavan makhaih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; atmana—by Himself; atmanam—Himself; ramah—Lord Ramacandra; uttama-kalpakaih—with very opulent paraphernalia; sarva-deva-mayam—the heart and soul of all the demigods; devam—the Supreme Lord Himself; ije—worshiped; atha—thus; acaryavan—under the guidance of an acarya; makhaih—by performing sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thereafter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ramacandra, accepted an acarya and performed sacrifices (yajnas) with opulent paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Thus He Himself worshiped Himself, for He is the Supreme Lord of all demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sarvarhanam acyutejya.</p>
<p>If Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshiped, then everyone is worshiped.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.31.14):</p>
<p>yatha taror mula-nisecanena</p>
<p>trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah</p>
<p>pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam</p>
<p>tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya</p>
<p>As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches, twigs and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality Performing yajna involves worshiping the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, bhagavan atmanatmanam ije: the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself.</p>
<p>This does not, of course, justify the Mayavada philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The jiva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The living entities (vibhinnamsa) never become one with the Lord, although Mayavadis sometimes imitate the Lord’s worship of Himself.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna meditated upon Himself every morning as a grhastha, and similarly Lord Ramacandra performed yajnas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of ahangraha-upasana.</p>
<p>Such unauthorized worship is not recommended herein.</p>
