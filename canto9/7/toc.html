<h1><a class="header" href="#the-descendants-of-king-mandhata" id="the-descendants-of-king-mandhata">The Descendants of King Mandhata</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#97" id="97">9.7</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of King Mandhata are described, and in this connection the histories of Purukutsa and Hariscandra are also given.</p>
<p>The most prominent son of Mandhata was Ambarisa, his son was Yauvanasva, and Yauvanasva’s son was Harita.</p>
<p>These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Mandhata.</p>
<p>Purukutsa, another son of Mandhata, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gana) named Narmada.</p>
<p>The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaranya.</p>
<p>Anaranya’s son was Haryasva, Haryasva’s son was Praruna, Praruna’s son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana’s son was Satyavrata, also known as Trisanku.</p>
<p>When Trisanku kidnapped the daughter of a brahmana, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Trisanku became a candala, worse than a sudra.</p>
<p>Later, by the influence of Visvamitra, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward.</p>
<p>He was stopped in his fall, however, by the influence of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra.</p>
<p>Hariscandra once performed a Rajasuya-yajna, but Visvamitra cunningly took all of Hariscandra’s possessions as a daksina contribution and chastised Hariscandra in various ways.</p>
<p>Because of this, a quarrel arose between Visvamitra and Vasistha.</p>
<p>Hariscandra had no sons, but on the advice of Narada he worshiped Varuna and in this way got a son named Rohita.</p>
<p>Hariscandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a Varuna-yajna.</p>
<p>Varuna reminded Hariscandra repeatedly about this yajna, but the King, because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him.</p>
<p>Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up.</p>
<p>To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at home, Hariscandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuna.</p>
<p>When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years and then returned home.</p>
<p>Rohita purchased Sunahsepha, the second son of Ajigarta, and gave him to his father, Hariscandra, as the sacrificial animal.</p>
<p>In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuna and the other demigods were pacified, and Hariscandra was freed from disease.</p>
<p>In this sacrifice, Visvamitra was the hota priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasistha was the brahma, and Ayasya was the udgata.</p>
<p>King Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariscandra a golden chariot, and Visvamitra gave him transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus Sukadeva Gosvami describes how Hariscandra achieved perfection.</p>
