<h1>The Descendants of King Mandhata</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.7</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of King Mandhata are described, and in this connection the histories of Purukutsa and Hariscandra are also given.</p>
<p>The most prominent son of Mandhata was Ambarisa, his son was Yauvanasva, and Yauvanasva’s son was Harita.</p>
<p>These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Mandhata.</p>
<p>Purukutsa, another son of Mandhata, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gana) named Narmada.</p>
<p>The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaranya.</p>
<p>Anaranya’s son was Haryasva, Haryasva’s son was Praruna, Praruna’s son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana’s son was Satyavrata, also known as Trisanku.</p>
<p>When Trisanku kidnapped the daughter of a brahmana, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Trisanku became a candala, worse than a sudra.</p>
<p>Later, by the influence of Visvamitra, he was brought to the heavenly planes, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward.</p>
<p>He was stopped in his fall, however, by the influence of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra.</p>
<p>Hariscandra once performed a Rajasuya-yajna, but Visvamitra cunningly took all of Hariscandra’s possessions as a daksina contribution and chastised Hariscandra in various ways.</p>
<p>Because of this, a quarrel arose between Visvamitra and Vasistha.</p>
<p>Hariscandra had no sons, but on the advice of Narada he worshiped Varuna and in this way got a son named Rohita.</p>
<p>Hariscandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a Varuna-yajna.</p>
<p>Varuna reminded Hariscandra repeatedly about this yajna, but the King, because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him.</p>
<p>Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up.</p>
<p>To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at home, Hariscandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuna.</p>
<p>When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years and then returned home.</p>
<p>Rohita purchased Sunahsepha, the second son of Ajigarta, and gave him to his father, Hariscandra, as the sacrificial animal.</p>
<p>In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuna and the other demigods were pacified, and Hariscandra was freed from disease.</p>
<p>In this sacrifice, Visvamitra was the hota priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasistha was the brahma, and Ayasya was the udgata.</p>
<p>King Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariscandra a golden chariot, and Visvamitra gave him transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus Sukadeva Gosvami describes how Hariscandra achieved perfection.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, by the power of Visvamitra, he did not fall all the way down; even today he can still be seen hanging in the sky, head downward.</p>



<p><strong>9.7.7</strong></p>
<p>traisankavo hariscandro</p>
<p>visvamitra-vasisthayoh</p>
<p>yan-nimittam abhud yuddham</p>
<p>paksinor bahu-varsikam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra.</p>
<p>Because of Hariscandra there was a quarrel between Visvamitra and Vasistha, who for many years fought one another, having been transformed into birds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Visvamitra and Vasistha were always inimical.</p>
<p>Formerly, Visvamitra was a ksatriya, and by undergoing severe austerities he wanted to become a brahmana, but Vasistha would not agree to accept him.</p>
<p>In this way there was always disagreement between the two.</p>
<p>Later, however, Vasistha accepted him because of Visvamitra’s quality of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Once Hariscandra performed a yajna for which Visvamitra was the priest, but Visvamitra, being angry at Hariscandra, took away all his possessions, claiming them as a contribution of daksina.</p>
<p>Vasistha, however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose between Vasistha and Visvamitra.</p>
<p>The fighting became so severe that each of them cursed the other.</p>
<p>One of them said, May you become a bird and the other said, May you become a duck Thus both of them became birds and continued fighting for many years because of Hariscandra.</p>
<p>We can see that such a great mystic yogi as Saubhari became a victim of sense gratification, and such great sages as Vasistha and Visvamitra became birds.</p>
<p>This is the material world.</p>
<p>Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino ’rjuna (Bg.8.16).</p>
<p>Within this material world, or within this universe, however elevated one may be in material qualities, one must suffer the conditions of birth, death, old age and disease (janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi).</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says that this material world is simply miserable (duhkhalayam asasvatam (Bg.8.15)).</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam says, padam padam yad vipadam: at every step here there is danger.</p>
<p>Therefore, because the Krsna consciousness movement provides the opportunity for the human being to get out of this material world simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, this movement is the greatest benediction in human society.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Hariscandra first purified his mind, which was full of material enjoyment, by amalgamating it with the earth.</p>
<p>Then he amalgamated the earth with water, the water with fire, the fire with the air, and the air with the sky.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he amalgamated the sky with the total material energy, and the total material energy with spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>This spiritual knowledge is realization of one’s self as part of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When the self-realized spiritual soul is engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally imperceptible and inconceivable.</p>
<p>Thus established in spiritual knowledge, he is completely freed from material bondage.</p>
