<h1><a class="header" href="#durvasa-munis-life-spared" id="durvasa-munis-life-spared">Durvasa Muni’s Life Spared</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#95" id="95">9.5</a></strong></p>
<p>In this chapter we find Maharaja Ambarisa offering prayers to the Sudarsana cakra and we find how the Sudarsana cakra became merciful to Durvasa Muni.</p>
<p>By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, Durvasa Muni immediately went to Maharaja Ambarisa and fell at his lotus feet.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa, being naturally very humble and meek, felt shy and ashamed because Durvasa Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers to the Sudarsana cakra just to save Durvasa.</p>
<p>What is this Sudarsana cakra? The Sudarsana cakra is the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world.</p>
<p>Sa aiksata, sa asrjata.</p>
<p>This is the Vedic version.</p>
<p>The Sudarsana cakra, which is the origin of creation and is most dear to the Lord, has thousands of spokes.</p>
<p>This Sudarsana cakra is the killer of the prowess of all other weapons, the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of establishing religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities.</p>
<p>Without his mercy, the universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarsana cakra is employed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Ambarisa thus prayed that the Sudarsana cakra be merciful, the Sudarsana cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durvasa Muni, who thus achieved the Sudarsana cakra’s mercy.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni thus learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaisnava an ordinary person (vaisnave jati-buddhi).</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa belonged to the ksatriya group, and therefore Durvasa Muni considered him lower than the brahmanas and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him.</p>
<p>By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>After this incident, Maharaja Ambarisa gave Durvasa Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also took prasada.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa later divided his property among his sons and went to the bank of the Manasa-sarovara to execute devotional meditation.</p>
