<p>This chapter describes the dynasties of four of them, beginning with Ksatravrddha.</p>
<p>Ayu, the son of Pururava, had five sons— Nahusa, Ksatravrddha, Raji, Rabha and Anena.</p>
<p>The son of Ksatravrddha was Suhotra, who had three sons, named Kasya, Kusa and Grtsamada.</p>
<p>The son of Grtsamada was Sunaka, and his son was Saunaka.</p>
<p>The son of Kasya was Kasi.</p>
<p>From Kasi came the sons and grandsons known as Rastra, Dirghatama and then Dhanvantari, who was the inaugurator of medical science and was a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva.</p>
<p>The descendants of Dhanvantari were Ketuman, Bhimaratha, Divodasa and Dyuman, who was also known as Pratardana, Satrujit, Vatsa, Rtadhvaja and Kuvalayasva.</p>
