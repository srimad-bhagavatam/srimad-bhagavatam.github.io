<p>Ayu, the eldest son of Pururava, had five sons.</p>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasties of four of them, beginning with Ksatravrddha.</p>
<p>Ayu, the son of Pururava, had five sons— Nahusa, Ksatravrddha, Raji, Rabha and Anena.</p>
<p>The son of Ksatravrddha was Suhotra, who had three sons, named Kasya, Kusa and Grtsamada.</p>
<p>The son of Grtsamada was Sunaka, and his son was Saunaka.</p>
<p>The son of Kasya was Kasi.</p>
<p>From Kasi came the sons and grandsons known as Rastra, Dirghatama and then Dhanvantari, who was the inaugurator of medical science and was a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva.</p>
<p>The descendants of Dhanvantari were Ketuman, Bhimaratha, Divodasa and Dyuman, who was also known as Pratardana, Satrujit, Vatsa, Rtadhvaja and Kuvalayasva.</p>
<p>The son of Dyuman was Alarka, who reigned over the kingdom for many, many years.</p>
<p>Following in the dynasty of Alarka were Santati, Sunitha, Niketana, Dharmaketu, Satyaketu, Dhrstaketu, Sukumara, Vitihotra, Bharga and Bhargabhumi.</p>
<p>All of them belonged to the dynasty of Kasi, the descendant of Ksatravrddha.</p>
<p>The son of Rabha was Rabhasa, and his son was Gambhira.</p>
<p>Gambhira’s son was Akriya, and from Akriya came Brahmavit.</p>
<p>The son of Anena was Suddha, and his son was Suci.</p>
<p>The son of Suci was Citrakrt, whose son was Santaraja.</p>
<p>Raji had five hundred sons, all of extraordinary strength.</p>
<p>Raji was personally very powerful and was given the kingdom of heaven by Lord Indra.</p>
<p>Later, after Raji’s death, when the sons of Raji refused to return the kingdom to Indra, by Brhaspati’s arrangement they became unintelligent, and Lord Indra conquered them.</p>
<p>The grandson of Ksatravrddha named Kusa gave birth to a son named Prati.</p>
<p>From Prati came Sanjaya; from Sanjaya, Jaya; from Jaya, Krta; and from Krta, Haryabala.</p>
<p>The son of Haryabala was Sahadeva; the son of Sahadeva, Hina; the son of Hina, Jayasena; the son of Jayasena, Sankrti; and the son of Sankrti, Jaya.</p>
