<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#910" id="910">9.10</a></strong></p>
<p>This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra appeared in the dynasty of Maharaja Khatvanga.</p>
<p>It also describes the Lord’s activities, telling how He killed Ravana and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of His kingdom.</p>
<p>The son of Maharaja Khatvanga was Dirghabahu, and his son was Raghu.</p>
<p>The son of Raghu was Aja, the son of Aja was Dasaratha, and the son of Dasaratha was Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion—as Lord Ramacandra, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna—great sages like Valmiki who were actually in knowledge of the Absolute Truth described His transcendental pastimes.</p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami describes these pastimes in brief.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra went with Visvamitra and killed Raksasas like Marica.</p>
<p>After breaking the stout and strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord married mother Sita and cut down the prestige of Parasurama.</p>
<p>To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Laksmana and Sita.</p>
<p>There He cut off the nose of Surpanakha and killed the associates of Ravana, headed by Khara and Dusana.</p>
<p>Ravana’s kidnapping of Sitadevi was the beginning of this demon’s misfortune.</p>
<p>When Marica assumed the form of a golden deer, Lord Ramacandra went to bring the deer to please Sitadevi, but in the meantime Ravana took advantage of the Lord’s absence to kidnap her.</p>
<p>When Sitadevi was kidnapped, Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Laksmana, searched for her throughout the forest.</p>
<p>In the course of this search, They met Jatayu.</p>
<p>Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Vali and established a friendly relationship with Sugriva.</p>
<p>After organizing the military strength of the monkeys and going with them to the shore of the sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when Samudra did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry.</p>
<p>Then Samudra came to the Lord with great haste and surrendered to Him, wanting to help Him in every way.</p>
<p>The Lord then attempted to bridge the ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhisana, He attacked Ravana’s capital, Lanka.</p>
<p>Previously, Hanuman, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Lanka, and now, with the help of Laksmana, the forces of Lord Ramacandra killed all the Raksasa soldiers.</p>
<p>Then Lord Ramacandra personally killed Ravana.</p>
<p>Mandodari and other wives lamented for Ravana, and in accordance with Lord Ramacandra’s order, Vibhisana performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in the family.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra then gave Vibhisana the right to rule Lanka and also granted him a long duration of life.</p>
<p>The Lord delivered Sitadevi from the Asoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His capital Ayodhya, where He was received by His brother Bharata.</p>
<p>When Lord Ramacandra entered Ayodhya, Bharata brought His wooden shoes, Vibhisana and Sugriva held a whisk and fan, Hanuman carried an umbrella, Satrughna carried the Lord’s bow and two quivers, and Sitadevi carried a waterpot containing water from holy places.</p>
<p>Angada carried a sword, and Jambavan (Rksaraja) carried a shield.</p>
<p>After Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Lord Laksmana and mother Sitadevi, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasistha enthroned Him as King.</p>
<p>The chapter ends with a short description of Lord Ramacandra’s rule in Ayodhya.</p>
