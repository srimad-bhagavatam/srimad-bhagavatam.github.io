<h1>The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu</h1>
<p><strong>9.2.1</strong></p>
<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>evam gate ’tha sudyumne</p>
<p>manur vaivasvatah sute</p>
<p>putra-kamas tapas tepe</p>
<p>yamunayam satam samah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam—thus; gate—had accepted the order of vanaprastha; atha—thereafter; sudyumne—when Sudyumna; manuh vaivasvatah—Vaivasvata Manu, known as Sraddhadeva; sute—his son; putra-kamah—desiring to get sons; tapah tepe—executed severe austerities; yamunayam—on the bank of the Yamuna; satam samah—for one hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thereafter, when his son Sudyumna had thus gone to the forest to accept the order of vanaprastha, Vaivasvata Manu (Sraddhadeva), being desirous of getting more sons, performed severe austerities on the bank of the Yamuna for one hundred years.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.2</strong></p>
<p>tato ’yajan manur devam</p>
<p>apatyartham harim prabhum</p>
<p>iksvaku-purvajan putran</p>
<p>lebhe sva-sadrsan dasa</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatah—thereafter; ayajat—worshiped; manuh—Vaivasvata Manu; devam—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; apatya-artham—with a desire to get sons; harim—unto Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; prabhum—the Lord; iksvaku-purva-jan—of whom the eldest was named Iksvaku; putran—sons; lebhe—got; sva-sadrsan—exactly like himself; dasa—ten.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then, because of this desire for sons, the Manu known as Sraddhadeva worshiped the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the demigods.</p>
<p>Thus he got ten sons exactly like himself.</p>
<p>Among them all, Iksvaku was the eldest.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.3</strong></p>
<p>prsadhras tu manoh putro</p>
<p>go-palo guruna krtah</p>
<p>palayam asa ga yatto</p>
<p>ratryam virasana-vratah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Among these sons, Prsadhra, following the order of his spiritual master, was engaged as a protector of cows.</p>
<p>He would stand all night with a sword to give the cows protection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who becomes virasana takes the vow to stand all night with a sword to give protection to the cows.</p>
<p>Because Prsadhra was engaged in this way, it is to be understood that he had no dynasty.</p>
<p>We can further understand from this vow accepted by Prsadhra how essential it is to protect the cows.</p>
<p>Some son of a ksatriya would take this vow to protect the cows from ferocious animals, even at night.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of sending cows to slaughterhouses? This is the most sinful activity in human society.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.4</strong></p>
<p>ekada pravisad gostham</p>
<p>sardulo nisi varsati</p>
<p>sayana gava utthaya</p>

<p>Once at night, while it was raining, a tiger entered the land of the cowshed.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the tiger, all the cows, who were lying down, got up in fear and scattered here and there on the land.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.5-6</strong></p>
<p>ekam jagraha balavan</p>
<p>sa cukrosa bhayatura</p>
<p>tasyas tu kranditam srutva</p>
<p>prsadhro ’nusasara ha</p>
<p>khadgam adaya tarasa</p>
<p>pralinodu-gane nisi</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the very strong tiger seized the cow, the cow screamed in distress and fear, and Prsadhra, hearing the screaming, immediately followed the sound.</p>
<p>He took up his sword, but because the stars were covered by clouds, he mistook the cow for the tiger and mistakenly cut off the cows’ head with great force.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.7</strong></p>
<p>vyaghro ’pi vrkna-sravano</p>
<p>nistrimsagrahatas tatah</p>
<p>niscakrama bhrsam bhito</p>
<p>raktam pathi samutsrjan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vyaghrah—the tiger; api—also; vrkna-sravanah—its ear being cut off; nistrimsa-agra-ahatah—because of being cut by the tip of the sword; tatah—thereafter; niscakrama—fled (from that place); bhrsam—very much; bhitah—being afraid; raktam—blood; pathi—on the road; samutsrjan—discharging.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because the tiger’s ear had been cut by the edge of the sword, the tiger was very afraid, and it fled from that place, while bleeding on the street.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.8</strong></p>
<p>manyamano hatam vyaghram</p>
<p>prsadhrah para-vira-ha</p>
<p>adraksit sva-hatam babhrum</p>
<p>vyustayam nisi duhkhitah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>manyamanah—thinking that; hatam—has been killed; vyaghram—the tiger; prsadhrah—Manu’s son Prsadhra; para-vira-ha—although quite able to punish the enemy; adraksit—saw; sva-hatam—had been killed by him; babhrum—the cow; vyustayam nisi—when the night had passed (in the morning); duhkhitah—became very much unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the morning, when Prsadhra, who was quite able to subdue his enemy, saw that he had killed the cow although at night he thought he had killed the tiger, he was very unhappy.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.9</strong></p>
<p>tam sasapa kulacaryah</p>
<p>krtagasam akamatah</p>
<p>na ksatra-bandhuh sudras tvam</p>
<p>karmana bhavitamuna</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tam—him (Prsadhra); sasapa—cursed; kula-acaryah—the family priest, Vasistha; krta-agasam—because of committing the great sin of killing a cow; akamatah—although he did not want to do it; na—not; ksatra-bandhuh—the family member of a ksatriya; sudrah tvam—you have behaved like a sudra; karmana—therefore by your fruitive reaction; bhavita—you shall become a sudra; amuna—because of killing the cow.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although Prsadhra had committed the sin unknowingly, his family priest, Vasistha, cursed him, saying, &quot;In your next life you shall not be able to become a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Instead, you shall take birth as a sudra because of killing the cow.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that Vasistha was not free from tamo-guna, the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>As the family priest or spiritual master of Prsadhra, Vasistha should have taken Prsadhra’s offense very lightly, but instead Vasistha cursed him to become a sudra.</p>
<p>It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to give him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement.</p>
<p>Vasistha, however, did just the opposite.</p>
<p>Therefore Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that he was durmati; in other words, his intelligence was not very good.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.10</strong></p>
<p>evam saptas tu guruna</p>
<p>pratyagrhnat krtanjalih</p>
<p>adharayad vratam vira</p>
<p>urdhva-reta muni-priyam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>evam—in this way; saptah—having been cursed; tu—but; guruna—by his spiritual master; pratyagrhnat—he (Prsadhra) accepted; krta-anjalih—with folded hands; adharayat—took up, assumed; vratam—the vow of brahmacarya; virah—that hero; urdhva-retah—having controlled his senses; muni-priyam—which is approved by the great sages.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the hero Prsadhra was thus cursed by his spiritual master, he accepted the curse with folded hands.</p>
<p>Then, having controlled his senses, he took the vow of brahmacarya, which is approved by all great sages.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.11-13</strong></p>
<p>vasudeve bhagavati</p>
<p>sarvatmani pare ’male</p>
<p>ekantitvam gato bhaktya</p>
<p>sarva-bhuta-suhrt samah</p>
<p>vimukta-sangah santatma</p>
<p>samyatakso ’parigrahah</p>
<p>yad-rcchayopapannena</p>
<p>kalpayan vrttim atmanah</p>
<p>atmany atmanam adhaya</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Prsadhra gained relief from all responsibilities, became peaceful in mind, and established control over all his senses.</p>
<p>Being unaffected by material conditions, being pleased with whatever was available by the grace of the Lord to maintain body and soul together, and being equal toward everyone, he gave full attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, who is the transcendental Supersoul, free from material contamination.</p>
<p>Thus Prsadhra, fully satisfied in pure knowledge, always keeping his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, achieved pure devotional service to the Lord and began traveling all over the world, without affection for material activities, as if he were deaf, dumb and blind.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.14</strong></p>
<p>evam vrtto vanam gatva</p>
<p>drstva davagnim utthitam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>With this attitude, Prsadhra became a great saint, and when he entered the forest and saw a blazing forest fire, he took this opportunity to burn his body in the fire.</p>
<p>Thus he achieved the transcendental, spiritual world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna Prsadhra, because of his karma, was cursed to take his next birth as a sudra, but because he took to saintly life, specifically concentrating his mind always upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Immediately after giving up his body in the fire, he reached the spiritual world, as mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (mam eti), as a result of his devotional situation.</p>
<p>Devotional service performed by thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that although Prsadhra was cursed he avoided the terrible consequence of becoming a sudra and instead returned home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.54):</p>
<p>yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karma-</p>
<p>bandhanurupa-phala-bhajanam atanoti</p>
<p>karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>Those who engage in devotional service are unaffected by the results of their material activities.</p>
<p>Otherwise, everyone, from the smallest microbe up to the King of heaven, Indra, is subject to the laws of karma.</p>
<p>A pure devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, is exempt from these laws.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.15</strong></p>
<p>kavih kaniyan visayesu nihsprho</p>
<p>visrjya rajyam saha bandhubhir vanam</p>
<p>nivesya citte purusam sva-rocisam</p>
<p>vivesa kaisora-vayah param gatah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kavih—another son, known as Kavi; kaniyan—who was the youngest; visayesu—in material enjoyments; nihsprhah—being without attachment; visrjya—after giving up; rajyam—his father’s property, the kingdom; saha bandhubhih—accompanied by friends; vanam—the forest; nivesya—keeping always; citte—within the core of the heart; purusam—the Supreme Person; sva-rocisam—self-effulgent; vivesa—entered; kaisora-vayah—a young man not fully in youth; param—the transcendental world; gatah—entered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Being reluctant to accept material enjoyment, Manu’s youngest son, whose name was Kavi, gave up the kingdom before attaining full youth.</p>
<p>Accompanied by his friends, he went to the forest, always thinking of the self-effulgent Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of his heart.</p>
<p>Thus he attained perfection.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.16</strong></p>
<p>karusan manavad asan</p>
<p>karusah ksatra-jatayah</p>
<p>uttara-patha-goptaro</p>
<p>brahmanya dharma-vatsalah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From Karusa, another son of Manu, came the Karusa dynasty, a family of ksatriyas.</p>
<p>The Karusa ksatriyas were the kings of the northern direction.</p>
<p>They were celebrated protectors of brahminical culture and were all firmly religious.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.17</strong></p>
<p>dhrstad dharstam abhut ksatram</p>
<p>brahma-bhuyam gatam ksitau</p>

<p>From the son of Manu named Dhrsta came a ksatriya caste called Dharsta, whose members achieved the position of brahmanas in this world.</p>
<p>Then, from the son of Manu named Nrga came Sumati.</p>
<p>From Sumati came Bhutajyoti, and from Bhutajyoti came Vasu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here it is said, ksatram brahma-bhuyam gatam ksitau: although the Dharstas belonged to the ksatriya caste, they were able to convert themselves into brahmanas.</p>
<p>This gives clear evidence supporting the following statement by Narada (Bhag.7.11.35):</p>
<p>yasya yal laksanam proktam</p>
<p>pumso varnabhivyanjakam</p>
<p>yad anyatrapi drsyeta</p>
<p>tat tenaiva vinirdiset</p>
<p>If the qualities of one group are found in the men of another, those men should be recognized by their qualities, by their symptoms, not by the caste of the family in which they were born.</p>
<p>Birth is not at all important; it is one’s qualities that are stressed in all Vedic literature.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.18</strong></p>
<p>vasoh pratikas tat-putra</p>
<p>oghavan oghavat-pita</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Agnivesya was also known as Kanina and Jatukarnya.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.22</strong></p>
<p>tato brahma-kulam jatam</p>

<p>Now that I have described the descendants of Narisyanta, let me describe the descendants of Dista.</p>
<p>Please hear from me.</p>



<p><strong>9.2.23-24</strong></p>
<p>nabhago dista-putro ’nyah</p>
<p>karmana vaisyatam gatah</p>
<p>bhalandanah sutas tasya</p>

<p>vatsapriteh sutah pramsus</p>
<p>tat-sutam pramatim viduh</p>
<p>khanitrah pramates tasmac</p>
<p>caksuso ’tha vivimsatih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nabhagah—by the name Nabhaga; dista-putrah—the son of Dista; anyah—another; karmana—by occupation; vaisyatam—the order of the vaisyas; gatah—achieved; bhalandanah—by the name Bhalandana; sutah—son; tasya—of him (Nabhaga); vatsapritih—by the name Vatsapriti; bhalandanat—from Bhalandana; vatsapriteh—from Vatsapriti; sutah—the son; pramsuh—was named Pramsu; tat-sutam—the son of him (Pramsu); pramatim—was named Pramati; viduh—you should understand; khanitrah—was named Khanitra; pramateh—from Pramati; tasmat—from him (Khanitra); caksusah—was named Caksusa; atha—thus (from Caksusa); vivimsatih—the son named Vivimsati.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dista had a son by the name Nabhaga.</p>
<p>This Nabhaga, who was different from the Nabhaga described later, became a vaisya by occupational duty.</p>
<p>The son of Nabhaga was known as Bhalandana, the son of Bhalandana was Vatsapriti, and his son was Pramsu.</p>
<p>Pramsu’s son was Pramati, Pramati’s son was Khanitra, Khanitra’s son was Caksusa, and his son was Vivimsati.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From Manu, one son became a ksatriya, another a brahmana, and another a vaisya.</p>
<p>This confirms the statement by Narada Muni, yasya yal laksanam proktam pumso varnabhivyanjakam (Bhag.7.11.35).</p>
<p>One should always remember that brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas should never be regarded as members of a caste by birth.</p>
<p>A brahmana may be changed into a ksatriya, and a ksatriya into a brahmana.</p>
<p>Similarly, a brahmana or ksatriya may be changed into a vaisya, and a vaisya into a brahmana or ksatriya.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>So one is a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya never by birth, but by quality.</p>
<p>There is a great need of brahmanas.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to train some brahmanas to guide human society.</p>
<p>Because at present there is a scarcity of brahmanas, the brain of human society is lost.</p>
