<h1>The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.8</strong></p>
<p>In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Rohita there was a king named Sagara, whose history is described in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of Sagara.</p>
<p>The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa, who constructed a township known as Campapuri.</p>
<p>The son of Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Vrka.</p>
<p>Bahuka, the son of Vrka, was greatly disturbed by his enemies, and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest.</p>
<p>When he died there, his wife wanted to accept the principles of sati, dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so.</p>
<p>The co-wives of this wife of Bahuka gave her poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison.</p>
<p>The son was therefore named Sagara (sa means with and gara means poiso).</p>
<p>Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and Barbaras.</p>
<p>The king did not kill them, but reformed them.</p>
<p>Then, again following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed asvamedha sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven.</p>
<p>King Sagara had two wives, named Sumati and Kesini.</p>
<p>While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sagara Ocean.</p>
<p>In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to have stolen the horse.</p>
<p>With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Kesini, the second wife of King Sagara, had a son named Asamanjasa, whose son Amsuman later searched for the horse and delivered his uncles.</p>
<p>Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Amsuman saw both the horse meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes.</p>
<p>Amsuman offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who returned the horse.</p>
<p>After getting back the horse, however, Amsuman still stood before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Amsuman was praying for the deliverance of his forefathers.</p>
<p>Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the Ganges.</p>
<p>Amsuman then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place with the horse for sacrifice.</p>
<p>When King Sagara finished his yajna, he handed over the kingdom to Amsuman and, following the advice of Aurva, attained salvation.</p>

<p>Thus these different clans were made to dress differently, but King Sagara did not kill them.</p>

<p>Consequently, fire emanated from their own bodies, and they were immediately burned to ashes.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material body is a combination of earth, water, fire, air and ether.</p>
<p>There is already fire within the body, and our practical experience is that the heat of this fire sometimes increases and sometimes decreases.</p>
<p>The fire within the bodies of the sons of Sagara Maharaja became so much hotter that all of them burned to ashes.</p>
<p>The fire’s increased heat was due to their misbehavior toward a great personality.</p>
<p>Such misbehavior is called mahad-vyatikrama.</p>
<p>They were killed by the fire of their own bodies because of insulting a great personality.</p>



<p><strong>9.8.12</strong></p>
<p>na sadhu-vado muni-kopa-bharjita</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>It is sometimes argued that the sons of King Sagara were burned to ashes by the fire emanating from the eyes of Kapila Muni.</p>
<p>This statement, however, is not approved by great learned persons, for Kapila Muni’s body is completely in the mode of goodness and therefore cannot manifest the mode of ignorance in the form of anger, just as the pure sky cannot be polluted by the dust of the earth.</p>



<p><strong>9.8.13</strong></p>
<p>yasyerita sankhyamayi drdheha naur</p>
<p>yaya mumuksus tarate duratyayam</p>
<p>bhavarnavam mrtyu-patham vipascitah</p>
<p>paratma-bhutasya katham prthan-matih</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Sankhya philosophy, which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean of nescience.</p>
<p>Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the material world may take shelter of this philosophy.</p>
<p>In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated platform of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is promoted to the transcendental position (brahma-bhuta) is always jubilant (prasannatma).</p>
<p>He is unaffected by the false distinctions between good and bad in the material world.</p>
<p>Therefore, such an exalted person is samah sarvesu bhutesu; that is to say, he is equal toward everyone, not distinguishing between friend and enemy.</p>
<p>Because he is on the absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is called paratma-bhuta or brahma-bhuta.</p>
<p>Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all angry at the sons of Sagara Maharaja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by the heat of their own bodies.</p>



<p><strong>9.8.14</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Among the sons of Sagara Maharaja was one named Asamanjasa, who was born from the King’s second wife, Kesini.</p>
<p>The son of Asamanjasa was known as Amsuman, and he was always engaged in working for the good of Sagara Maharaja, his grandfather.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Formerly, in his previous birth, Asamanjasa had been a great mystic yogi, but by bad association he had fallen from his exalted position.</p>
<p>Now, in this life, he was born in a royal family and was a jati-smara; that is, he had the special advantage of being able to remember his past birth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he wanted to display himself as a miscreant, and therefore he would do things that were abominable in the eyes of the public and unfavorable to his relatives.</p>
<p>He would disturb the boys sporting in the River Sarayu by throwing them into the depths of the water.</p>



<p><strong>9.8.17</strong></p>
<p>evam vrttah parityaktah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because Asamanjasa engaged in such abominable activities, his father gave up affection for him and had him exiled.</p>
<p>Then Asamanjasa exhibited his mystic power by reviving the boys and showing them to the King and their parents.</p>
<p>After this, Asamanjasa left Ayodhya.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Asamanjasa was a jati-smara; because of his mystic power, he did not forget his previous consciousness.</p>
<p>Thus he could give life to the dead.</p>
<p>By exhibiting wonderful activities in relation to the dead children, he certainly attracted the attention of the King and the people in general.</p>
<p>Then he left that place immediately.</p>



<p><strong>9.8.18</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, when all the inhabitants of Ayodhya saw that their boys had come back to life, they were astounded, and King Sagara greatly lamented the absence of his son.</p>



<p><strong>9.8.19</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Amsuman said: My Lord, even Lord Brahma is to this very day unable to understand Your position, which is far beyond himself, either by meditation or by mental speculation.</p>
<p>So what to speak of others like us, who have been created by Brahma in various forms as demigods, animals, human beings, birds and beasts? We are completely in ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore, how can we know You, who are the Transcendence?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>iccha-dvesa-samutthena</p>
<p>dvandva-mohena bharata</p>
<p>sarva-bhutani sammoham</p>
<p>sarge yanti parantapa</p>
<p>O scion of Bharata (Arjuna), O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate (Bg.7.27) All living beings in the material world are influenced by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Even Lord Brahma is in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Similarly, the demigods are generally in the mode of passion, and living entities lower than the demigods, such as human beings and animals, are in the mode of ignorance, or in mixed goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore Amsuman wanted to explain that because his uncles, who had burnt to ashes, were under the modes of material nature, they could not understand Lord Kapiladeva Because You are beyond even the direct and indirect intelligence of Lord Brahma he prayed, unless we are enlightened by Your Lordship it will not be possible for us to understand You</p>
<p>athapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-</p>
<p>prasada-lesanugrhita eva hi</p>

<p>na canya eko ’pi ciram vicinvan</p>
<p>My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality.</p>
<p>But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years (Bhag.10.14.29) The Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can be understood by one who is favored by the Lord; the Lord cannot be understood by others.</p>

<p>gunan vipasyanty uta va tamas ca</p>
<p>yan-mayaya mohita-cetasas tvam</p>
<p>viduh sva-samstham na bahih-prakasah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ye—those persons who; deha-bhajah—have accepted the material body; tri-guna-pradhanah—influenced by the three modes of material nature; gunan—the manifestation of the three modes of material nature; vipasyanti—can see only; uta—it is so said; va—either; tamah—the mode of ignorance; ca—and; yat-mayaya—by the illusory energy of whom; mohita—has been bewildered; cetasah—the core of whose heart; tvam—Your Lordship; viduh—know; sva-samstham—situated in one’s own body; na—not; bahih-prakasah—those who can see only the products of external energy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone’s heart, but the living entities, covered by the material body, cannot see You, for they are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Their intelligence being covered by sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna, they can see only the actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Because of the actions and reactions of the mode of ignorance, whether the living entities are awake or sleeping, they can see only the workings of material nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, one is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>However, because the conditioned souls are influenced by material nature, they can see only the actions and reactions of material nature, but not the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One therefore must purify himself internally and externally:</p>
<p>apavitrah pavitro va</p>
<p>sarvavastham gato ’pi va</p>
<p>yah smaret pundarikaksam</p>
<p>sa bahyabhyantarah sucih</p>
<p>To keep ourselves externally clean we should bathe three times daily, and for internal cleanliness we must cleanse the heart by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>The members of the Krsna consciousness movement must always follow this principle (bahyabhyantarah sucih).</p>
<p>Then it will one day be possible to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.</p>

<p>sanandanadyair munibhir vibhavyam</p>
<p>katham vimudhah paribhavayami</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tam—that personality; tvam—unto You; aham—I; jnana-ghanam—Your Lordship, who are concentrated knowledge; svabhava—by spiritual nature; pradhvasta—free from contamination; maya-guna—caused by the three modes of material nature; bheda-mohaih—by exhibition of the bewilderment of differentiation; sanandana-adyaih—by such personalities as the four Kumaras (Sanat-kumara, Sanaka, Sanandana and Sanatana); munibhih—by such great sages; vibhavyam—worshipable; katham—how; vimudhah—being fooled by the material nature; paribhavayami—can I think of You.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, sages freed from the influence of the three modes of material nature—sages such as the four Kumaras (Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana and Sanatana)—are able to think of You, who are concentrated knowledge.</p>
<p>But how can an ignorant person like me think of You?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word svabhava refers to one’s own spiritual nature or original constitutional position.</p>
<p>When situated in this original position, the living entity is unaffected by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg.14.26).</p>
<p>As soon as one is freed from the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is situated on the Brahman platform.</p>
<p>Vivid examples of personalities thus situated are the four Kumaras and Narada.</p>
<p>Such authorities can by nature understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but a conditioned soul not freed from the influence of material nature is unable to realize the Supreme.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.45), therefore, Krsna advises Arjuna, traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna: one must rise above the influence of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>One who stays within the influence of the three material modes is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prasanta—O completely peaceful one; maya-guna—the modes of material nature; karma-lingam—symptomized by fruitive activities; anama-rupam—one who has no material name or form; sat-asat-vimuktam—transcendental to the manifested and nonmanifested modes of material nature; jnana-upadesaya—for distributing transcendental knowledge (as in Bhagavad-gita); grhita-deham—has assumed a form like a material body; namamahe—I offer my respectful obeisances; tvam—unto You; purusam—the Supreme Person; puranam—the original.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O completely peaceful Lord, although material nature, fruitive activities and their consequent material names and forms are Your creation, You are unaffected by them.</p>
<p>Therefore, Your transcendental name is different from material names, and Your form is different from material forms.</p>
<p>You assume a form resembling a material body just to give us instructions like those of Bhagavad-gita, but actually You are the supreme original person.</p>
<p>I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Stotra-ratna (43):</p>
<p>bhavantam evanucaran nirantarah</p>
<p>prasanta-nihsesa-manorathantarah</p>
<p>kadaham aikantika-nitya-kinkarah</p>
<p>praharsayisyami sanatha-jivitam</p>
<p>By serving You constantly, one is freed from all material desires and is completely pacified.</p>
<p>When shall I engage as Your permanent eternal servant and always feel joyful to have such a fitting master Manorathenasati dhavato bahih: (SB 5.18.12) one who acts on the mental platform must descend to material activities.</p>
<p>Material contamination, however, is completely absent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is addressed as prasanta, completely peaceful, free from the disturbances of material existence.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord has no material name or form; only the foolish think that the Lord’s name and form are material (avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam (Bg.9.11)).</p>
<p>The identity of the Supreme Lord is that He is the original person.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those who have but a poor fund of knowledge think that the Lord is formless.</p>
<p>The Lord is formless in the material sense, but He has His transcendental form (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1)).</p>

<p>Attached to home, wife and children, they wander in this material world perpetually.</p>

<p>O Supersoul of all living entities, O Personality of Godhead, simply by seeing You I have now been freed from all lusty desires, which are the root cause of insurmountable illusion and bondage in the material world.</p>
