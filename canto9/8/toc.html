<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#98" id="98">9.8</a></strong></p>
<p>In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Rohita there was a king named Sagara, whose history is described in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of Sagara.</p>
<p>The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa, who constructed a township known as Campapuri.</p>
<p>The son of Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Vrka.</p>
<p>Bahuka, the son of Vrka, was greatly disturbed by his enemies, and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest.</p>
<p>When he died there, his wife wanted to accept the principles of sati, dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so.</p>
<p>The co-wives of this wife of Bahuka gave her poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison.</p>
<p>The son was therefore named Sagara (sa means with and gara means poiso).</p>
<p>Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and Barbaras.</p>
<p>The king did not kill them, but reformed them.</p>
<p>Then, again following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed asvamedha sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven.</p>
<p>King Sagara had two wives, named Sumati and Kesini.</p>
<p>While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sagara Ocean.</p>
<p>In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to have stolen the horse.</p>
<p>With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Kesini, the second wife of King Sagara, had a son named Asamanjasa, whose son Amsuman later searched for the horse and delivered his uncles.</p>
<p>Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Amsuman saw both the horse meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes.</p>
<p>Amsuman offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who returned the horse.</p>
<p>After getting back the horse, however, Amsuman still stood before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Amsuman was praying for the deliverance of his forefathers.</p>
<p>Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the Ganges.</p>
<p>Amsuman then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place with the horse for sacrifice.</p>
<p>When King Sagara finished his yajna, he handed over the kingdom to Amsuman and, following the advice of Aurva, attained salvation.</p>
