<p>This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed by Karusa.</p>
<p>After Sudyumna accepted the order of vanaprastha and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like Maharaja Iksvaku, all of whom were like their father.</p>
<p>One of these sons, Prsadhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night.</p>
<p>Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Prsadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow.</p>
<p>Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a sudra family, but Prsadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood.</p>
<p>From Manu’s son known as Karusa, a sect of ksatriyas known as Karusas was generated.</p>
<p>Manu also had a son known as Dhrsta, from whom another sect of ksatriyas was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a ksatriya, they became brahmanas.</p>
<p>From Nrga, another son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhutajyoti and Vasu.</p>
<p>From Vasu, in succession, came Pratika, and from him came Oghavan.</p>
<p>Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Narisyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Rksa, Midhvan, Purna, Indrasena, Vitihotra, Satyasrava, Urusrava, Devadatta and Agnivesya.</p>
<p>From the ksatriya known as Agnivesya came the celebrated brahmana dynasty known as Agnivesyayana.</p>
<p>From the seminal dynasty of Dista, another son of Manu, came Nabhaga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapriti, Pramsu, Pramati, Khanitra, Caksusa, Vivimsati, Rambha, Khaninetra, Karandhama, Aviksit, Marutta, Dama, Rajyavardhana, Sudhrti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhuman, Vegavan, Budha and Trnabindu.</p>
<p>In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty.</p>
<p>From Trnabindu came a daughter named Ilavila, from whom Kuvera took birth.</p>
<p>Trnabindu also had three sons, named Visala, Sunyabandhu and Dhumraketu.</p>
<p>The son of Visala was Hemacandra, his son was Dhumraksa, and his son was Samyama.</p>
<p>The sons of Samyama were Devaja and Krsasva.</p>
<p>Krsasva’s son, Somadatta, performed an Asvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.</p>
