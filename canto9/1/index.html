<p><strong>9.2</strong></p>
<p>This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed by Karusa.</p>
<p>After Sudyumna accepted the order of vanaprastha and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like Maharaja Iksvaku, all of whom were like their father.</p>
<p>One of these sons, Prsadhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night.</p>
<p>Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Prsadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow.</p>
<p>Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a sudra family, but Prsadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood.</p>
<p>From Manu’s son known as Karusa, a sect of ksatriyas known as Karusas was generated.</p>
<p>Manu also had a son known as Dhrsta, from whom another sect of ksatriyas was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a ksatriya, they became brahmanas.</p>
<p>From Nrga, another son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhutajyoti and Vasu.</p>
<p>From Vasu, in succession, came Pratika, and from him came Oghavan.</p>
<p>Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Narisyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Rksa, Midhvan, Purna, Indrasena, Vitihotra, Satyasrava, Urusrava, Devadatta and Agnivesya.</p>
<p>From the ksatriya known as Agnivesya came the celebrated brahmana dynasty known as Agnivesyayana.</p>
<p>From the seminal dynasty of Dista, another son of Manu, came Nabhaga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapriti, Pramsu, Pramati, Khanitra, Caksusa, Vivimsati, Rambha, Khaninetra, Karandhama, Aviksit, Marutta, Dama, Rajyavardhana, Sudhrti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhuman, Vegavan, Budha and Trnabindu.</p>
<p>In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty.</p>
<p>From Trnabindu came a daughter named Ilavila, from whom Kuvera took birth.</p>
<p>Trnabindu also had three sons, named Visala, Sunyabandhu and Dhumraketu.</p>
<p>The son of Visala was Hemacandra, his son was Dhumraksa, and his son was Samyama.</p>
<p>The sons of Samyama were Devaja and Krsasva.</p>
<p>Krsasva’s son, Somadatta, performed an Asvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>9.1.17</strong></p>
<p>bhagavan kim idam jatam</p>
<p>karma vo brahma-vadinam</p>
<p>viparyayam aho kastam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My lord, all of you are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>How then has the result been opposite to the one desired? This is a matter for lamentation.</p>
<p>There should not have been such a reversal of the results of the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this age, the performance of yajna has been forbidden because no one can properly chant the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>If Vedic mantras are chanted properly, the desire for which a sacrifice is performed must be successful.</p>
<p>Therefore the Hare Krsna chant is called the maha-mantra, the great, exalted mantra above all other Vedic mantras, because simply chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra brings so many beneficial effects.</p>
<p>As explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (Siksastaka1):</p>
<p>ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam</p>
<p>sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranam vidya-vadhu-jivanam</p>
<p>anandambudhi-vardhanam prati-padam purnamrtasvadanam</p>
<p>sarvatma-snapanam param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam</p>
<p>(Cc.Antya 20.12)</p>
<p>Glory to the Sri Krsna sankirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>This sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon.</p>
<p>It is the life of all transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious Therefore, the best performance of yajna given to us is the sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag.11.5.32).</p>
<p>Those who are intelligent take advantage of the greatest yajna in this age by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in congregation.</p>
<p>When the Hare Krsna mantra is chanted by many men together, the chanting is called sankirtana, and as a result of such a yajna there will be clouds in the sky (yajnad bhavati parjanyah (Bg.3.14)).</p>
<p>In these days of drought, people can gain relief from scarcity of rain and food by the simple method of the Hare Krsna yajna.</p>
<p>Indeed, this can relieve all of human society.</p>
<p>At present there are droughts throughout Europe and America, and people are suffering, but if people take this Krsna consciousness movement seriously, if they stop their sinful activities and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, all their problems will be solved without difficulty.</p>
<p>In other processes of yajna there are difficulties because there are no learned scholars who can chant the mantras perfectly well, nor is it possible to secure the ingredients to perform the yajna.</p>
<p>Because human society is poverty-stricken and men are devoid of Vedic knowledge and the power to chant the Vedic mantras, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only shelter people should be intelligent enough to chant it.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (SB 11.5.32).</p>
<p>Those whose brains are dull cannot understand this chanting, nor can they take to it.</p>



<p><strong>9.1.18</strong></p>
<p>yuyam brahma-vido yuktas</p>
<p>tapasa dagdha-kilbisah</p>
<p>kutah sankalpa-vaisamyam</p>
<p>anrtam vibudhesv iva</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yuyam—of all you; brahma-vidah—completely in awareness of the Absolute Truth; yuktah—self-controlled and well balanced; tapasa—by dint of austerity and penances; dagdha-kilbisah—all kinds of material contamination having been burnt out; kutah—then how; sankalpa-vaisamyam—discrepancy in the matter of determination; anrtam—false promise, false statement; vibudhesu—in the society of the demigods; iva—or.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You are all self-controlled, well balanced in mind, and aware of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>And because of austerities and penances you are completely cleansed of all material contamination.</p>
<p>Your words, like those of the demigods, are never baffled.</p>
<p>Then how is it possible that your determination has failed?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We have learned from many Vedic literatures that a benediction or curse given by the demigods never proves false.</p>
<p>By performing austerities and penances, by controlling the senses and mind, and by achieving full knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one is fully cleansed of material contamination.</p>
<p>Then one’s words and blessings, like those of the demigods, are never a failure.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The most powerful great-grandfather Vasistha, after hearing these words of Manu, understood the discrepancy on the part of the priest.</p>
<p>Thus he spoke as follows to the son of the sun-god.</p>



<p><strong>9.1.20</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This discrepancy in the objective is due to your priest’s deviation from the original purpose.</p>
<p>However, by my own prowess I shall give you a good son.</p>

<p>Since that time, no male had entered that forest.</p>
<p>But now King Sudyumna, having been transformed into a female, began to walk with his associates from one forest to another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.22) it is said:</p>
<p>vasamsi jirnani yatha vihaya</p>
<p>navani grhnati naro ’parani</p>
<p>tatha sarirani vihaya jirnany</p>
<p>anyani samyati navani dehi</p>
<p>As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones The body is just like a dress, and here this is proved.</p>
<p>Sudyumna and his associates were all male, which means that their souls were covered by male dress, but now they became female, which means that their dress was changed.</p>
<p>The soul, however, remains the same.</p>
<p>It is said that by modern medical treatment a male can be transformed into a female, and a female into a male.</p>
<p>The body, however, has no connection with the soul.</p>
<p>The body can be changed, either in this life or the next.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who has knowledge of the soul and how the soul transmigrates from one body to another does not pay attention to the body, which is nothing but a covering dress.</p>
<p>Panditah sama-darsinah (Bg.5.18).</p>
<p>Such a person sees the soul, which is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore he is a sama-darsi, a learned person.</p>

<p>tustas tasmai sa bhagavan</p>
<p>rsaye priyam avahan</p>
<p>svam ca vacam rtam kurvann</p>
<p>idam aha visampate</p>
<p>masam puman sa bhavita</p>
<p>masam stri tava gotrajah</p>

<p>Therefore, to satisfy him and to keep his own word to Parvati, Lord Siva said to that saintly person, Your disciple Sudyumna may remain a male for one month and a female for the next.</p>
<p>In this way he may rule the world as he likes</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word gotrajah is significant in this connection.</p>
<p>Brahmanas generally act as spiritual masters of two dynasties.</p>
<p>One is their disciplic succession, and the other is the dynasty born of their semen.</p>
<p>Both descendants belong to the same gotra, or dynasty.</p>
<p>In the Vedic system we sometimes find that both brahmanas and ksatriyas and even vaisyas come in the disciplic succession of the same rsis.</p>
<p>Because the gotra and dynasty are one, there is no difference between the disciples and the family born of the semen.</p>
<p>The same system still prevails in Indian society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the gotra is calculated.</p>
<p>Here the word gotrajah refers to those born in the same dynasty, whether they be disciples or members of the family.</p>



<p><strong>9.1.40</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus being favored by the spiritual master, according to the words of Lord Siva, Sudyumna regained his desired maleness every alternate month and in this way ruled the kingdom, although the citizens were not satisfied with this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The citizens could understand that the king was transformed into a female every alternate month and therefore could not discharge his royal duty.</p>
<p>Consequently they were not very satisfied.</p>



<p><strong>9.1.41</strong></p>
<p>tasyotkalo gayo rajan</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king of the world, was sufficiently old, he delivered the entire kingdom to his son Pururava and entered the forest.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of varna and asrama must leave his family life after he reaches fifty years of age (pancasad urdhvam vanam vrajet).</p>
<p>Thus Sudyumna followed the prescribed regulations of varnasrama by leaving the kingdom and going to the forest to complete his spiritual life.</p>
