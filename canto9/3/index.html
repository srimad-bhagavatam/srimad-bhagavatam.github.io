<h1>The Marriage of Sukanya and Cyavana Muni</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.3</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty of Saryati, another son of Manu, and also tells about Sukanya and Revati.</p>
<p>Devajna Saryati gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic ceremony observed on the second day of the yajna of the Angirasas.</p>
<p>One day, Saryati, along with his daughter, known as Sukanya, went to the asrama of Cyavana Muni.</p>
<p>There Sukanya saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances.</p>
<p>As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze from that hole.</p>
<p>Consequently, King Saryati and his companions suffered from constipation and inability to pass urine.</p>
<p>When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanya was the cause of this misfortune.</p>
<p>Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devajna Saryati offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very old man.</p>
<p>When the heavenly physicians the Asvini-kumara brothers once visited Cyavana Muni, the muni requested them to give him back his youth.</p>
<p>These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake, in which they bathed and regained full youth.</p>
<p>After this, Sukanya could not distinguish her husband.</p>
<p>She then surrendered unto the Asvini-kumaras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore introduced her again to her husband.</p>
<p>Cyavana Muni then engaged King Saryati in performing the soma-yajna and gave the Asvini-kumaras the privilege to drink soma-rasa.</p>
<p>The King of heaven, Lord Indra, became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Saryati.</p>
<p>Henceforward, the Asvini-kumara physicians were able to share in the soma-rasa.</p>
<p>Saryati later had three sons, named Uttanabarhi, Anarta and Bhurisena.</p>
<p>Anarta had one son, whose name was Revata.</p>
<p>Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmi.</p>
<p>Kakudmi was advised by Lord Brahma to offer his beautiful daughter, Revati, to Baladeva, who belongs to the visnu-tattva category.</p>
<p>After doing this, Kakudmi retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarikasrama to execute austerities and penances.</p>

<p>The King, after hearing the statement of his daughter, certainly told the great sage Cyavana Muni everything about how his daughter had ignorantly committed such an offense.</p>

<p>Thus with the permission of the great sage the King returned home.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.10</strong></p>
<p>sukanya cyavanam prapya</p>
<p>patim parama-kopanam</p>
<p>prinayam asa citta-jna</p>
<p>apramattanuvrttibhih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sukanya—the girl named Sukanya, the daughter of King Saryati; cyavanam—the great sage Cyavana Muni; prapya—after obtaining; patim—as her husband; parama-kopanam—who was always very angry; prinayam asa—she satisfied him; citta-jna—understanding the mind of her husband; apramatta anuvrttibhih—by executing services without being bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanya had gotten him as her husband, she dealt with him carefully, according to his mood.</p>
<p>Knowing his mind, she performed service to him without being bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife.</p>
<p>A great personality like Cyavana Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be in a superior position.</p>
<p>Such a person cannot submit to anyone.</p>
<p>Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament.</p>
<p>His wife, Sukanya, could understand his attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him accordingly.</p>
<p>If any wife wants to be happy with her husband, she must try to understand her husband’s temperament and please him.</p>
<p>This is victory for a woman.</p>
<p>Even in the dealings of Lord Krsna with His different queens, it has been seen that although the queens were the daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord Krsna as His maidservants.</p>
<p>However great a woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is to say, she must be ready to carry out her husband’s orders and please him in all circumstances.</p>
<p>Then her life will be successful.</p>
<p>When the wife becomes as irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or ultimately completely broken.</p>
<p>In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore home life is broken even by slight incidents.</p>
<p>Either the wife or the husband may take advantage of the divorce laws.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic law, however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be trained to be submissive to the will of her husband.</p>
<p>Westerners contend that this is a slave mentality for the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband, however irritable or cruel he may be.</p>
<p>In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not young but indeed old enough to be Sukanya’s grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukanya, the beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to please him in all respects.</p>
<p>Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.11</strong></p>
<p>kasyacit tv atha kalasya</p>
<p>nasatyav asramagatau</p>
<p>tau pujayitva provaca</p>
<p>vayo me dattam isvarau</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kasyacit—after some (time); tu—but; atha—in this way; kalasya—time having passed; nasatyau—the two Asvini-kumaras; asrama—that place of Cyavana Muni; agatau—reached; tau—unto those two; pujayitva—offering respectful obeisances; provaca—said; vayah—youth; me—unto me; dattam—please give; isvarau—because you two are able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, some time having passed, the Asvini-kumara brothers, the heavenly physicians, happened to come to Cyavana Muni’s asrama.</p>
<p>After offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana Muni requested them to give him youthful life, for they were able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The heavenly physicians like the Asvini-kumaras could give youthful life even to one who was advanced in age.</p>
<p>Indeed, great yogis, with their mystic powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the structure of the body is in order.</p>
<p>We have already discussed this in connection with Bali Maharaja’s soldiers and their treatment by Sukracarya.</p>
<p>Modern medical science has not yet discovered how to bring a dead body back to life or bring youthful energy to an old body, but from these verses we can understand that such treatment is possible if one is able to take knowledge from the Vedic information.</p>
<p>The Asvini-kumaras were expert in Ayur-veda, as was Dhanvantari.</p>
<p>In every department of material science, there is a perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>The highest perfection is to become a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>To attain this perfection, one must consult Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic desire tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam (SB 1.1.3)).</p>



<p><strong>9.3.12</strong></p>
<p>graham grahisye somasya</p>
<p>yajne vam apy asoma-poh</p>
<p>kriyatam me vayo-rupam</p>
<p>pramadanam yad ipsitam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>graham—a full pot; grahisye—I shall give; somasya—of soma-rasa; yajne—in sacrifice; vam—of both of you; api—although; asoma-poh—of you two, who are not eligible to drink soma-rasa; kriyatam—just execute; me—my; vayah—young age; rupam—beauty of a young man; pramadanam—of women as a class; yat—which is; ipsitam—desirable.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Cyavana Muni said: Although you are ineligible to drink soma-rasa in sacrifices, I promise to give you a full pot of it.</p>
<p>Kindly arrange beauty and youth for me, because they are attractive to young women.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.13</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great physicians, the Asvini-kumaras, very gladly accepted Cyavana Muni’s proposal.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.14</strong></p>
<p>ity ukto jaraya grasta-</p>
<p>deho dhamani-santatah</p>
<p>hradam pravesito ’svibhyam</p>
<p>vali-palita-vigrahah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>iti uktah—thus being addressed; jaraya—by old age and invalidity; grasta-dehah—the body being so diseased; dhamani-santatah—whose veins were visible everywhere on the body; hradam—the lake; pravesitah—entered; asvibhyam—helped by the Asvini-kumaras; vali-palita-vigrahah—whose body had loose skin and white hair.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After saying this, the Asvini-kumaras caught hold of Cyavana Muni, who was an old, diseased invalid with loose skin, white hair, and veins visible all over his body, and all three of them entered the lake.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Cyavana Muni was so old that he could not enter the lake alone.</p>
<p>Thus the Asvini-kumaras caught hold of his body, and the three of them entered the lake.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.15</strong></p>
<p>purusas traya uttasthur</p>
<p>apivya vanita-priyah</p>

<p>They were nicely dressed and decorated with earrings and garlands of lotuses.</p>
<p>All of them were of the same standard of beauty.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.16</strong></p>
<p>tan niriksya vararoha</p>
<p>sarupan surya-varcasah</p>
<p>ajanati patim sadhvi</p>
<p>asvinau saranam yayau</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tan—unto them; niriksya—after observing; vara-aroha—that beautiful Sukanya; sa-rupan—all of them equally beautiful; surya-varcasah—with a bodily effulgence like the effulgence of the sun; ajanati—not knowing; patim—her husband; sadhvi—that chaste woman; asvinau—unto the Asvini-kumaras; saranam—shelter; yayau—took.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The chaste and very beautiful Sukanya could not distinguish her husband from the two Asvini-kumaras, for they were equally beautiful.</p>
<p>Not understanding who her real husband was, she took shelter of the Asvini-kumaras.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sukanya could have selected any one of them as her husband, for one could not distinguish among them, but because she was chaste, she took shelter of the Asvini-kumaras so that they could inform her who her actual husband was.</p>
<p>A chaste woman will never accept any man other than her husband, even if there be someone equally as handsome and qualified.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.17</strong></p>

<p>Thus they showed her Cyavana Muni, her husband, and after taking permission from him, they returned to the heavenly planes in their plane.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.18</strong></p>
<p>yaksyamano ’tha saryatis</p>

<p>There he saw by the side of his daughter a very beautiful young man, as bright as the sun.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.19</strong></p>

<p><strong>9.3.20</strong></p>
<p>cikirsitam te kim idam patis tvaya</p>
<p>pralambhito loka-namaskrto munih</p>
<p>yat tvam jara-grastam asaty asammatam</p>
<p>vihaya jaram bhajase ’mum adhvagam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>cikirsitam—which you desire to do; te—of you; kim idam—what is this; patih—your husband; tvaya—by you; pralambhitah—has been cheated; loka-namaskrtah—who is honored by all people; munih—a great sage; yat—because; tvam—you; jara-grastam—very old and invalid; asati—O unchaste daughter; asammatam—not very attractive; vihaya—giving up; jaram—paramour; bhajase—you have accepted; amum—this man; adhvagam—comparable to a street beggar.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O unchaste girl, what is this that you have desired to do? You have cheated the most respectable husband, who is honored by everyone, for I see that because he was old, diseased and therefore unattractive, you have left his company to accept as your husband this young man, who appears to be a beggar from the street.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This shows the values of Vedic culture.</p>
<p>According to the circumstances, Sukanya had been given a husband who was too old to be compatible with her.</p>
<p>Because Cyavana Muni was diseased and very old, he was certainly unfit for the beautiful daughter of King Saryati.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, her father expected her to be faithful to her husband.</p>
<p>When he suddenly saw that his daughter had accepted someone else, even though the man was young and handsome, he immediately chastised her as asati, unchaste, because he assumed that she had accepted another man in the presence of her husband.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, even if a young woman is given an old husband, she must respectfully serve him.</p>
<p>This is chastity.</p>
<p>It is not that because she dislikes her husband she may give him up and accept another.</p>
<p>This is against Vedic culture.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the husband given to her by her parents and remain chaste and faithful to him.</p>
<p>Therefore King Saryati was surprised to see a young man by the side of Sukanya.</p>



<p><strong>9.3.21</strong></p>
<p>katham matis te ’vagatanyatha satam</p>
<p>kula-prasute kula-dusanam tv idam</p>
<p>bibharsi jaram yad apatrapa kulam</p>
<p>pitus ca bhartus ca nayasy adhas tamah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>katham—how; matih te—your consciousness; avagata—has gone down; anyatha—otherwise; satam—of the most respectable; kula-prasute—O my daughter, born in the family; kula-dusanam—who are the degradation of the family; tu—but; idam—this; bibharsi—you are maintaining; jaram—a paramour; yat—as it is; apatrapa—without shame; kulam—the dynasty; pituh—of your father; ca—and; bhartuh—of your husband; ca—and; nayasi—you are bringing down; adhah tamah—downward into darkness or hell.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my daughter, who were born in a respectable family, how have you degraded your consciousness in this way? How is it that you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus degrade the dynasties of both your father and your husband to hellish life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father’s family and the family of her husband.</p>
<p>The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas even today; only the sudras are degraded in this matter.</p>
<p>For a woman of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the Vedic culture.</p>
<p>Therefore King Saryati, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni’s transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter.</p>
