<h1><a class="header" href="#the-marriage-of-sukanya-and-cyavana-muni" id="the-marriage-of-sukanya-and-cyavana-muni">The Marriage of Sukanya and Cyavana Muni</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#93" id="93">9.3</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty of Saryati, another son of Manu, and also tells about Sukanya and Revati.</p>
<p>Devajna Saryati gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic ceremony observed on the second day of the yajna of the Angirasas.</p>
<p>One day, Saryati, along with his daughter, known as Sukanya, went to the asrama of Cyavana Muni.</p>
<p>There Sukanya saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances.</p>
<p>As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze from that hole.</p>
<p>Consequently, King Saryati and his companions suffered from constipation and inability to pass urine.</p>
<p>When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanya was the cause of this misfortune.</p>
<p>Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devajna Saryati offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very old man.</p>
<p>When the heavenly physicians the Asvini-kumara brothers once visited Cyavana Muni, the muni requested them to give him back his youth.</p>
<p>These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake, in which they bathed and regained full youth.</p>
<p>After this, Sukanya could not distinguish her husband.</p>
<p>She then surrendered unto the Asvini-kumaras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore introduced her again to her husband.</p>
<p>Cyavana Muni then engaged King Saryati in performing the soma-yajna and gave the Asvini-kumaras the privilege to drink soma-rasa.</p>
<p>The King of heaven, Lord Indra, became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Saryati.</p>
<p>Henceforward, the Asvini-kumara physicians were able to share in the soma-rasa.</p>
<p>Saryati later had three sons, named Uttanabarhi, Anarta and Bhurisena.</p>
<p>Anarta had one son, whose name was Revata.</p>
<p>Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmi.</p>
<p>Kakudmi was advised by Lord Brahma to offer his beautiful daughter, Revati, to Baladeva, who belongs to the visnu-tattva category.</p>
<p>After doing this, Kakudmi retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarikasrama to execute austerities and penances.</p>
