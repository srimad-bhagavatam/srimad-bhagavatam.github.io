<h1>The Downfall of Saubhari Muni</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>9.6</strong></p>
<p>After describing the descendants of Maharaja Ambarisa, Sukadeva Gosvami described all the kings from Sasada to Mandhata, and in this connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the daughters of Mandhata.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa had three sons, named Virupa, Ketuman and Sambhu.</p>
<p>The son of Virupa was Prsadasva, and his son was Rathitara.</p>
<p>Rathitara had no sons, but when he requested the favor of the great sage Angira, the sage begot several sons in the womb of Rathitara’s wife.</p>
<p>When the sons were born, they became the dynasty of Angira Rsi and of Rathitara.</p>
<p>The son of Manu was Iksvaku, who had one hundred sons, of whom Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were the eldest.</p>
<p>The sons of Maharaja Iksvaku became kings of different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Because of violating sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikuksi, was banished from the kingdom.</p>
<p>By the mercy of Vasistha and the power of mystic yoga, Maharaja Iksvaku attained liberation after giving up his material body.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Iksvaku expired, his son Vikuksi returned and took charge of the kingdom.</p>
<p>He performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This Vikuksi later became celebrated as Sasada.</p>
<p>Vikuksi’s son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods, and because of his valuable service he became famous as Puranjaya, Indravaha and Kakutstha.</p>
<p>The son of Puranjaya was Anena, the son of Anena was Prthu, and the son of Prthu was Visvagandhi.</p>
<p>The son of Visvagandhi was Candra, the son of Candra was Yuvanasva, and his son was Sravasta, who constructed Sravasti Puri.</p>
<p>The son of Sravasta was Brhadasva.</p>
<p>Brhadasva’s son Kuvalayasva killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated as Dhundhumara, the killer of Dhundhu The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Drdhasva, Kapilasva and Bhadrasva.</p>
<p>He also had thousands of other sons, but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from Dhundhu.</p>
<p>The son of Drdhasva was Haryasva, the son of Haryasva was Nikumbha, the son of Nikumbha was Bahulasva, and the son of Bahulasva was Krsasva.</p>
<p>The son of Krsasva was Senajit, and his son was Yuvanasva.</p>
<p>Yuvanasva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore he entered the forest.</p>
<p>In the forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as Indra-yajna on his behalf.</p>
<p>Once, however, the King became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing yajna.</p>
<p>Consequently, after some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen.</p>
<p>The son, who was very beautiful, was crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck.</p>
<p>Thus the son became known as Mandhata.</p>
<p>In due course of time, Yuvanasva achieved perfection by performing austerities.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Mandhata became the emperor and ruled the earth, which consists of seven islands.</p>
<p>Thieves and rogues were very much afraid of this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as Trasaddasyu, meaning one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves Mandhata begot sons in the womb of his wife, Bindumati.</p>
<p>These sons were Purukutsa, Ambarisa and Mucukunda.</p>
<p>These three sons had fifty sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari.</p>
<p>In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of Saubhari Muni, who, because of sensual agitation caused by fish, fell from his yoga and wanted to marry all the daughters of Mandhata for sexual pleasure.</p>
<p>Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful.</p>
<p>Thus he accepted the order of vanaprastha, performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection.</p>
<p>In this regard, Sukadeva Gosvami described how Saubhari Muni’s wives also became perfect.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: O Maharaja Pariksit, Ambarisa had three sons, named Virupa, Ketuman and Sambhu.</p>
<p>From Virupa came a son named Prsadasva, and from Prsadasva came a son named Rathitara.</p>

<p>rathitarasyaprajasya</p>
<p>bharyayam tantave ’rthitah</p>
<p>angira janayam asa</p>
<p>brahma-varcasvinah sutan</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>rathitarasya—of Rathitara; aprajasya—who had no sons; bharyayam—unto his wife; tantave—for increasing offspring; arthitah—being requested; angirah—the great sage Angira; janayam asa—caused to take birth; brahma-varcasvinah—who had brahminical qualities; sutan—sons.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Rathitara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Angira to beget sons for him.</p>
<p>Because of this request, Angira begot sons in the womb of Rathitara’s wife.</p>
<p>All these sons were born with brahminical prowess.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the womb of a lesser man’s wife for the sake of better progeny.</p>
<p>In such an instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field.</p>
<p>A person possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it, but because the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the property of the owner of the land.</p>
<p>Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but the sons born of her would then become her husband’s sons.</p>
<p>Such sons were called ksetra jata.</p>
<p>Because Rathitara had no sons, he took advantage of this method.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.3</strong></p>
<p>ete ksetra-prasuta vai</p>
<p>punas tv angirasah smrtah</p>
<p>rathitaranam pravarah</p>
<p>ksetropeta dvi-jatayah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ete—the sons begotten by Angira; ksetra-prasutah—became the children of Rathitara and belonged to his family (because they were born from the womb of his wife); vai—indeed; punah—again; tu—but; angirasah—of the dynasty of Angira; smrtah—they were called; rathitaranam—of all the sons of Rathitara; pravarah—the chief; ksetra-upetah—because of being born of the ksetra (field); dvi-jatayah—called brahmana (being a mixture of brahmana and ksatriya).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Having been born from the womb of Rathitara’s wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of Rathitara, but because they were born from the semen of Angira, they were also known as the dynasty of Angira.</p>
<p>Among all the progeny of Rathitara, these sons were the most prominent because, owing to their birth, they were considered brahmanas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the meaning of dvi jatayah as mixed caste indicating a mixture of brahmana and ksatriya.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.4</strong></p>
<p>ksuvatas tu manor jajne</p>
<p>iksvakur ghranatah sutah</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The son of Manu was Iksvaku.</p>
<p>When Manu was sneezing, Iksvaku was born from Manu’s nostrils.</p>
<p>King Iksvaku had one hundred sons, of whom Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were the most prominent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Sridhara Svami, although the Bhagavatam (9.1.11–12) has previously included Iksvaku among the ten sons begotten by Manu in his wife Sraddha, this was a generalization.</p>
<p>It is here specifically explained that Iksvaku was born simply from the sneezing of Manu.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.5</strong></p>

<p>The other sons became kings in various other places.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>During the months of January, February and March, oblations offered to the forefathers are called astaka-sraddha.</p>
<p>The sraddha ceremony is held during the dark fortnight of the month.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Iksvaku was performing his oblations in this ceremony, he ordered his son Vikuksi to go immediately to the forest to bring some pure flesh.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.7</strong></p>
<p>tatheti sa vanam gatva</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Iksvaku’s son Vikuksi went to the forest and killed many animals suitable for being offered as oblations.</p>
<p>But when fatigued and hungry he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had killed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is evident that ksatriyas killed animals in the forest because the flesh of the animals was suitable to be offered at a particular type of yajna.</p>
<p>Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as sraddha is also a kind of yajna.</p>
<p>In this yajna, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered.</p>
<p>However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden.</p>
<p>Quoting from the Brahma-vaivarta Purana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:</p>
<p>asvamedham gavalambham</p>
<p>sannyasam pala-paitrkam</p>
<p>devarena sutotpattim</p>
<p>kalau panca vivarjayet</p>
<p>(Cc.Adi 17.164)</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife The word pala-paitrkam refers to an offering of flesh in oblations to forefathers.</p>
<p>Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden.</p>
<p>In this age, Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are sudras, not ksatriyas.</p>
<p>According to Vedic injunctions, however, only ksatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas sudras are allowed to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess Kali or similar demigods.</p>
<p>On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions.</p>
<p>As far as eating beef is concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone.</p>
<p>Thus in Bhagavad-gita Krsna personally speaks of go-raksyam, cow protection.</p>
<p>Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the sastra, are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows.</p>
<p>Cows must be given all protection.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.8</strong></p>
<p>sesam nivedayam asa</p>
<p>pitre tena ca tad-guruh</p>
<p>coditah proksanayaha</p>
<p>dustam etad akarmakam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sesam—the remnants; nivedayam asa—he offered; pitre—to his father; tena—by him; ca—also; tat-guruh—their priest or spiritual master; coditah—being requested; proksanaya—for purifying; aha—said; dustam—polluted; etat—all this flesh; akarmakam—not fit to be used for offering in sraddha.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Vikuksi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Iksvaku, who gave it to Vasistha for purification.</p>
<p>But Vasistha could immediately understand that part of the flesh had already been taken by Vikuksi, and therefore he said that it was unfit to be used in the sraddha ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>That which is meant to be offered in yajna cannot be tasted by anyone before being offered to the Deity.</p>
<p>In our temples, this regulation is in effect.</p>
<p>One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the Deity.</p>
<p>If something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire preparation is polluted and can no longer be offered.</p>
<p>Those engaged in Deity worship must know this very well so that they may be saved from committing offenses in Deity worship.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.9</strong></p>
<p>jnatva putrasya tat karma</p>
<p>gurunabhihitam nrpah</p>
<p>desan nihsarayam asa</p>
<p>sutam tyakta-vidhim rusa</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When King Iksvaku, thus informed by Vasistha, understood what his son Vikuksi had done, he was extremely angry.</p>
<p>Thus he ordered Vikuksi to leave the country because Vikuksi had violated the regulative principles.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.10</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Having been instructed by the great and learned brahmana Vasistha, who discoursed about the Absolute Truth, Maharaja Iksvaku became renounced.</p>
<p>By following the principles for a yogi, he certainly achieved the supreme perfection after giving up his material body.</p>

<p>Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras perfectly, his severe austerities resulted in an opulent home, with garments, ornaments, properly dressed and decorated maidservants and manservants, and varieties of parks with clear-water lakes and gardens.</p>
<p>In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of flowers, birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by professional singers.</p>
<p>Saubhari Muni’s home was amply provided with valuable beds, seats, ornaments, and arrangements for bathing, and there were varieties of sandalwood creams, flower garlands, and palatable dishes.</p>
<p>Thus surrounded by opulent paraphernalia, the muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous wives.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Saubhari Rsi was a great yogi.</p>
<p>Yogic perfection makes available eight material opulences—anima, laghima, mahima, prapti, prakamya, isitva, vasitva and kamavasayita.</p>
<p>Saubhari Muni exhibited super-excellence in material enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection.</p>
<p>The word bahv-rca means expert in chanting mantras As material opulence can be achieved by ordinary material means, it can also be achieved by subtle means through mantras.</p>
<p>By chanting mantras, Saubhari Muni arranged for material opulence, but this was not perfection in life.</p>
<p>As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the vanaprastha order and achieved final success.</p>
<p>Those who are not atma-tattva-vit, who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be satisfied with external material opulences, but those who are atma-tattva-vit are not inspired by material opulence.</p>
<p>This is the instruction we can derive from the life and activities of Saubhari Muni.</p>

<p>evam—in this way; grhesu—in household affairs; abhiratah—being always engaged; visayan—material paraphernalia; vividhaih—with varieties of; sukhaih—happiness; sevamanah—enjoying; na—not; ca—also; atusyat—satisfied him; ajya-stokaih—by drops of fat; iva—like; analah—a fire.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this way, Saubhari Muni enjoyed sense gratification in the material world, but he was not at all satisfied, just as a fire never ceases blazing if constantly supplied with drops of fat.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material desire is just like a blazing fire.</p>
<p>If a fire is continually supplied with drops of fat, the fire will increase more and more and never be extinguished.</p>
<p>Therefore the policy of trying to satisfy material desires by catering to one’s material demands will never be successful.</p>
<p>In modern civilization, everyone is engaged in economic development, which is another way of constantly dropping fat into the material fire.</p>
<p>The Western countries have reached the summit of material civilization, but people are still dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Real satisfaction is Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), where Krsna says:</p>
<p>bhoktaram yajna-tapasam</p>
<p>sarva-loka-mahesvaram</p>
<p>suhrdam sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>jnatva mam santim rcchati</p>
<p>The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planes and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries One must therefore take to Krsna consciousness and advance in Krsna consciousness by properly following the regulative principles.</p>
<p>Then one can attain an eternal, blissful life in peace and knowledge.</p>

<p>sa kadacid upasina</p>
<p>atmapahnavam atmanah</p>
<p>dadarsa bahv-rcacaryo</p>
<p>mina-sanga-samutthitam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—he, Saubhari Muni; kadacit—one day; upasinah—sitting down; atma-apahnavam—degrading oneself from the platform of tapasya; atmanah—self-caused; dadarsa—observed; bahu-rca-acaryah—Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting mantras; mina-sanga—the sexual affairs of fish; samutthitam—caused by this incident.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting mantras, was sitting in a secluded place, he thought to himself about the cause of his falldown, which was simply that he had associated himself with the sexual affairs of the fish.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen from his austerity because of a vaisnava-aparadha.</p>
<p>The history is that when Garuda wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter under his care.</p>
<p>Because Garuda’s plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Because of this vaisnava-aparadha, an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>This is the lesson we must learn from this incident concerning Saubhari Muni.</p>

<p>tapasvinah sac-carita-vratasya</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Alas! While practicing austerity, even within the depths of the water, and while observing all the rules and regulations practiced by saintly persons, I lost the results of my long austerities simply by association with the sexual affairs of fish.</p>
<p>Everyone should observe this falldown and learn from it.</p>

<p>sangam tyajeta mithuna-vratinam mumuksuh</p>
<p>sarvatmana na visrjed bahir-indriyani</p>
<p>ekas caran rahasi cittam ananta ise</p>
<p>yunjita tad-vratisu sadhusu cet prasangah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person desiring liberation from material bondage must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and should not employ his senses externally (in seeing, hearing, talking, walking and so on).</p>
<p>One should always stay in a secluded place, completely fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the unlimited Personality of Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he should associate with persons similarly engaged.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical experience, instructs us that persons interested in crossing to the other side of the material ocean must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and accumulating money.</p>
<p>This is also advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu:</p>
<p>niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukasya</p>
<p>param param jigamisor bhava-sagarasya</p>
<p>sandarsanam visayinam atha yositam ca</p>
<p>ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato ’py asadhu</p>
<p>(Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka8.27)</p>
<p>Alas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He must not associate with visayi—materialistic persons or those interested in sex life.</p>
<p>Every materialist is interested in sex.</p>
<p>Thus in plain language it is advised that an exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who are materially inclined.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura also recommends that one engage in the service of the acaryas, and if one wants to live in association, he must live in the association of devotees (tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa).</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is creating many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the members of such a center people will automatically become uninterested in material affairs.</p>
<p>Although this is an ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>By gradually associating with the members of the Krsna consciousness movement, simply by taking prasada and taking part in chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably elevated.</p>
<p>Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the water.</p>
<p>Because of the bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell down.</p>
<p>A secluded place is also not secure unless there is good association.</p>

<p>nantam vrajamy ubhaya-krtya-manorathanam</p>
<p>maya-gunair hrta-matir visaye ’rtha-bhavah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ekah—one only; tapasvi—great sage; aham—I; atha—thus; ambhasi—in the deep water; matsya-sangat—by associating with the fish; pancasat—fifty; asam—got wives; uta—and what to speak of begetting one hundred sons in each of them; panca-sahasra-sargah—procreation of five thousand; na antam—no end; vrajami—I can find; ubhaya-krtya—duties of this life and the next; manorathanam—mental concoctions; maya-gunaih—influenced by the modes of material nature; hrta—lost; matih visaye—great attraction for material things; artha-bhavah—matters of self-interest.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning I was alone and engaged in performing the austerities of mystic yoga, but later, because of the association of fish engaged in sex, I desired to marry.</p>
<p>Then I became the husband of fifty wives, and in each of them I begot one hundred sons, and thus my family increased to five thousand members.</p>
<p>By the influence of the modes of material nature, I became fallen and thought that I would be happy in material life.</p>
<p>Thus there is no end to my material desires for enjoyment, in this life and the next.</p>

<p>evam—in this way; vasan—living; grhe—at home; kalam—passing away time; viraktah—became detached; nyasam—in the renounced order of life; asthitah—became situated; vanam—in the forest; jagama—he went; anuyayuh—was followed by; tat-patnyah—all his wives; pati-devatah—because their only worshipable object was their husband.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this way he passed his life in household affairs for some time, but then he became detached from material enjoyment.</p>
<p>To renounce material association, he accepted the vanaprastha order and went to the forest.</p>
<p>His devoted wives followed him, for they had no shelter other than their husband.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.54</strong></p>
<p>tatra taptva tapas tiksnam</p>
<p>atma-darsanam atmavan</p>
<p>sahaivagnibhir atmanam</p>
<p>yuyoja paramatmani</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatra—in the forest; taptva—executing austerity; tapah—the regulative principles of austerity; tiksnam—very severely; atma-darsanam—which helps self-realization; atmavan—conversant with the self; saha—with; eva—certainly; agnibhih—fires; atmanam—the personal self; yuyoja—he engaged; parama-atmani—dealing with the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Saubhari Muni, who was quite conversant with the self, went to the forest, he performed severe penances.</p>
<p>In this way, in the fire at the time of death, he ultimately engaged himself in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>At the time of death, fire burns the gross body, and if there is no more desire for material enjoyment the subtle body is also ended, and in this way a pure soul remains.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: (Bg.4.9) he goes back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage.</p>



<p><strong>9.6.55</strong></p>
<p>tah sva-patyur maharaja</p>
<p>niriksyadhyatmikim gatim</p>
<p>anviyus tat-prabhavena</p>
<p>agnim santam ivarcisah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tah—all the wives of Saubhari; sva-patyuh—with their own husband; maharaja—O King Pariksit; niriksya—observing; adhyatmikim—spiritual; gatim—progress; anviyuh—followed; tat-prabhavena—by the influence of their husband (although they were unfit, by the influence of their husband they also could go to the spiritual world); agnim—the fire; santam—completely merged; iva—like; arcisah—the flames.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Maharaja Pariksit, by observing their husband progressing in spiritual existence, Saubhari Muni’s wives were also able to enter the spiritual world by his spiritual power, just as the flames of a fire cease when the fire is extinguished.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.32), striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te ’pi yanti param gatim.</p>
<p>Women are not considered very powerful in following spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a suitable husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the same benefit as her husband.</p>
<p>Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the spiritual world by the influence of their husband.</p>
<p>They were unfit, but because they were faithful followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him.</p>
<p>Thus a woman should be a faithful servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.</p>
