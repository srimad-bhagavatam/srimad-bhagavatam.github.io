<h1><a class="header" href="#the-manus-administrators-of-the-universe" id="the-manus-administrators-of-the-universe">The Manus, Administrators of the Universe</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#81" id="81">8.1</a></strong></p>
<p>First of all, let me offer my humble, respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master, His Divine Grace Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada.</p>
<p>Sometime in the year 1935 when His Divine Grace was staying at Radha-kunda, I went to see him from Bombay.</p>
<p>At that time, he gave me many important instructions in regard to constructing temples and publishing books.</p>
<p>He personally told me that publishing books is more important than constructing temples.</p>
<p>Of course, those same instructions remained within my mind for many years.</p>
<p>In 1944 I began publishing my Back to Godhead, and when I retired from family life in 1958 I began publishing Srimad-Bhagavatam in Delhi.</p>
<p>When three parts of Srimad-Bhagavatam had been published in India, I then started for the United States of America on the thirteenth of August, 1965.</p>
<p>I am continuously trying to publish books, as suggested by my spiritual master.</p>
<p>Now, in this year, 1976, I have completed the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and a summary of the Tenth Canto has already been published as Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Still, the Eighth Canto, Ninth Canto, Tenth Canto, Eleventh Canto and Twelfth Canto are yet to be published.</p>
<p>On this occasion, therefore, I am praying to my spiritual master to give me strength to finish this work.</p>
<p>I am neither a great scholar nor a great devotee; I am simply a humble servant of my spiritual master, and to the best of my ability I am trying to please him by publishing these books, with the cooperation of my disciples in America.</p>
<p>Fortunately, scholars all over the world are appreciating these publications.</p>
<p>Let us cooperatively publish more and more volumes of Srimad-Bhagavatam just to please His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura.</p>
<p>This First Chapter of the Eighth Canto may be summarized as a description of four Manus, namely Svayambhuva, Svarocisa, Uttama and Tamasa.</p>
<p>After hearing descriptions of the dynasty of Svayambhuva Manu until the end of the Seventh Canto, Maharaja Pariksit desired to know about other Manus.</p>
<p>He desired to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends—not only in the past but at the present and in the future—and how He acts in various pastimes as Manu.</p>
<p>Since Pariksit Maharaja was eager to know all this, Sukadeva Gosvami gradually described all the Manus, beginning with the six Manus who had appeared in the past.</p>
<p>The first Manu was Svayambhuva Manu.</p>
<p>His two daughters, namely Akuti and Devahuti, gave birth to two sons, named Yajna and Kapila respectively.</p>
<p>Because Sukadeva Gosvami had already described the activities of Kapila in the Third Canto, he now described the activities of Yajna.</p>
<p>The original Manu, along with his wife, Satarupa, went into the forest to practice austerities on the bank of the River Sunanda.</p>
<p>They practiced austerities for a hundred years, and then Manu, in a trance, formed prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Raksasas and asuras then attempted to devour him, but Yajna, accompanied by his sons the Yamas and the demigods, killed them.</p>
<p>Then Yajna personally took the post of Indra, the King of the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>The second Manu, whose name was Svarocisa, was the son of Agni, and His sons were headed by Dyumat, Susena and Rocismat.</p>
<p>In the age of this Manu, Rocana became Indra, the ruler of the heavenly planets, and there were many demigods, headed by Tusita.</p>
<p>There were also many saintly persons, such as Urja and Stambha.</p>
<p>Among them was Vedasira, whose wife, Tusita, gave birth to Vibhu.</p>
<p>Vibhu instructed eighty-eight thousand drdha-vratas, or saintly persons, on self-control and austerity.</p>
<p>Uttama, the son of Priyavrata, was the third Manu.</p>
<p>Among his sons were Pavana, Srnjaya and Yajnahotra.</p>
<p>During the reign of this Manu, the sons of Vasistha, headed by Pramada, became the seven saintly persons.</p>
<p>The Satyas, Devasrutas and Bhadras became the demigods, and Satyajit became Indra.</p>
<p>From the womb of Sunrta, the wife of Dharma, the Lord appeared as Satyasena, and He killed all the Yaksas and Raksasas who were fighting with Satyajit.</p>
<p>Tamasa, the brother of the third Manu, was the fourth Manu, and he had ten sons, including Prthu, Khyati, Nara and Ketu.</p>
<p>During his reign, the Satyakas, Haris, Viras and others were demigods, the seven great saints were headed by Jyotirdhama, and Trisikha became Indra.</p>
<p>Harimedha begot a son named Hari in the womb of his wife Harini.</p>
<p>This Hari, an incarnation of God, saved the devotee Gajendra.</p>
<p>This incident is described as gajendra-moksana.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, Pariksit Maharaja particularly asks about this incident.</p>
