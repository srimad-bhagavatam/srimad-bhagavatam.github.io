<h1><a class="header" href="#lord-vamanadeva-the-dwarf-incarnation" id="lord-vamanadeva-the-dwarf-incarnation">Lord Vamanadeva, the Dwarf Incarnation</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#818" id="818">8.18</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Vamanadeva appeared and how He went to the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali, who received Him well and fulfilled His desire by offering Him benedictions.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell, disc, club and lotus.</p>
<p>His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu appeared at an auspicious moment on Sravana-dvadasi when the Abhijit star had arisen.</p>
<p>At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the brahmanas and even the seasons were happy because of God’s appearance.</p>
<p>Therefore this auspicious day is called Vijaya.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a sac-cid-ananda body, appeared as the son of Kasyapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished.</p>
<p>After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (Vamana).</p>
<p>All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with Kasyapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord Vamana.</p>
<p>At the time of Lord Vamanadeva’s sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, Brhaspati, the goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord Brahma, Kuvera, the seven rsis and others.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side of the Narmada River, at the field known as Bhrgukaccha, where brahmanas of the Bhrgu dynasty were performing yajnas.</p>
<p>Wearing a belt made of munja straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread and carrying in His hands a danda, an umbrella and a waterpot (kamandalu), Lord Vamanadeva appeared in the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali.</p>
<p>Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Even Lord Siva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Therefore, after washing the Lord’s feet, Bali Maharaja immediately accepted the water from the Lord’s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified.</p>
<p>Then Bali Maharaja inquired of Lord Vamanadeva’s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire.</p>

<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>ittham virinca-stuta-karma-viryah</p>
<p>pradurbabhuvamrta-bhur adityam</p>
<p>catur-bhujah sankha-gadabja-cakrah</p>
<p>pisanga-vasa nalinayateksanah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; ittham—in this way; virinca-stuta-karma-viryah—the Personality of Godhead, whose activities and prowess are always praised by Lord Brahma; pradurbabhuva—became manifested; amrta-bhuh—whose appearance is always deathless; adityam—from the womb of Aditi; catuh-bhujah—having four arms; sankha-gada-abja-cakrah—decorated with conchshell, club, lotus and disc; pisanga-vasah—dressed in yellow garments; nalina-ayata-iksanah—having blooming eyes like the petals of a lotus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: After Lord Brahma had thus spoken, glorifying the Supreme Lord’s activities and prowess, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never subject to death like an ordinary living being, appeared from the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>His four hands were decorated with a conchshell, club, lotus and disc, He was dressed in yellow garments, and His eyes appeared like the petals of a blooming lotus.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word amrta-bhuh is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>The Lord sometimes appears like an ordinary child taking birth, but this does not mean that He is subject to birth, death or old age.</p>
<p>One must be very intelligent to understand the appearance and activities of the Supreme Lord in His incarnations.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9): janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah.</p>
<p>One should try to understand that the Lord’s appearance and disappearance and His activities are all divyam, or transcendental.</p>
<p>The Lord has nothing to do with material activities.</p>
<p>One who understands the appearance, disappearance and activities of the Lord is immediately liberated.</p>
<p>After giving up his body, he never again has to accept a material body, but is transferred to the spiritual world (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>
