<h1>Lord Vamanadeva, the Dwarf Incarnation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.18</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Vamanadeva appeared and how He went to the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali, who received Him well and fulfilled His desire by offering Him benedictions.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell, disc, club and lotus.</p>
<p>His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu appeared at an auspicious moment on Sravana-dvadasi when the Abhijit star had arisen.</p>
<p>At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planeary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the brahmanas and even the seasons were happy because of God’s appearance.</p>
<p>Therefore this auspicious day is called Vijaya.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a sac-cid-ananda body, appeared as the son of Kasyapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished.</p>
<p>After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (Vamana).</p>
<p>All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with Kasyapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord Vamana.</p>
<p>At the time of Lord Vamanadeva’s sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, Brhaspati, the goddess presiding over the plane earth, the deity of the heavenly planes, His mother, Lord Brahma, Kuvera, the seven rsis and others.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side of the Narmada River, at the field known as Bhrgukaccha, where brahmanas of the Bhrgu dynasty were performing yajnas.</p>
<p>Wearing a belt made of munja straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread and carrying in His hands a danda, an umbrella and a waterpot (kamandalu), Lord Vamanadeva appeared in the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali.</p>
<p>Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Even Lord Siva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Therefore, after washing the Lord’s feet, Bali Maharaja immediately accepted the water from the Lord’s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified.</p>
<p>Then Bali Maharaja inquired of Lord Vamanadeva’s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire.</p>

<p>pisanga-vasa nalinayateksanah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; ittham—in this way; virinca-stuta-karma-viryah—the Personality of Godhead, whose activities and prowess are always praised by Lord Brahma; pradurbabhuva—became manifested; amrta-bhuh—whose appearance is always deathless; adityam—from the womb of Aditi; catuh-bhujah—having four arms; sankha-gada-abja-cakrah—decorated with conchshell, club, lotus and disc; pisanga-vasah—dressed in yellow garments; nalina-ayata-iksanah—having blooming eyes like the petals of a lotus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: After Lord Brahma had thus spoken, glorifying the Supreme Lord’s activities and prowess, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never subject to death like an ordinary living being, appeared from the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>His four hands were decorated with a conchshell, club, lotus and disc, He was dressed in yellow garments, and His eyes appeared like the petals of a blooming lotus.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word amrta-bhuh is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>The Lord sometimes appears like an ordinary child taking birth, but this does not mean that He is subject to birth, death or old age.</p>
<p>One must be very intelligent to understand the appearance and activities of the Supreme Lord in His incarnations.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9): janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah.</p>
<p>One should try to understand that the Lord’s appearance and disappearance and His activities are all divyam, or transcendental.</p>
<p>The Lord has nothing to do with material activities.</p>
<p>One who understands the appearance, disappearance and activities of the Lord is immediately liberated.</p>
<p>After giving up his body, he never again has to accept a material body, but is transferred to the spiritual world (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>

<p>When the Lord appeared, wearing the Kaustubha gem on His neck, His effulgence vanquished the darkness in the home of the Prajapati Kasyapa.</p>

<p><strong>8.18.5</strong></p>
<p>sronayam sravana-dvadasyam</p>
<p>muhurte ’bhijiti prabhuh</p>
<p>sarve naksatra-taradyas</p>
<p>cakrus taj-janma daksinam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sronayam—when the moon was situated in the Sravana lunar mansion; sravana-dvadasyam—on the twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bhadra, the day famous as the Sravana-dvadasi; muhurte—in the auspicious moment; abhijiti—in the first portion of the Sravana lunar mansion known as the Abhijit-naksatra and in the Abhijit-muhurta (occurring at midday); prabhuh—the Lord; sarve—all; naksatra—stars; tara—planes; adyah—beginning with the sun and followed by the other planes; cakruh—made; tat-janma—the birthday of the Lord; daksinam—very munificent.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>On the day of Sravana-dvadasi (the twelfth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bhadra), when the moon came into the lunar mansion Sravana, at the auspicious moment of Abhijit, the Lord appeared in this universe.</p>
<p>Considering the Lord’s appearance very auspicious, all the stars and planes, from the sun to Saturn, were munificently charitable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, an expert astrologer, explains the word naksatra-taradyah.</p>
<p>The word naksatra means the stars the word tara in this context refers to the planes, and adyah means the first one specifically mentioned Among the planes, the first is Surya, the sun, not the moon.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the Vedic version, the modern astronomer’s proposition that the moon is nearest to the earth should not be accepted.</p>
<p>The chronological order in which people all over the world refer to the days of the week—Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday—corresponds to the Vedic order of the planes and thus circumstantiates the Vedic version.</p>
<p>Apart from this, when the Lord appeared the planes and stars became situated very auspiciously, according to astrological calculations, to celebrate the birth of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, when the Lord appeared—on dvadasi, the twelfth day of the moon—the sun was at the meridian, as every learned scholar knows.</p>
<p>This dvadasi is called Vijaya.</p>

<p><strong>8.18.12</strong></p>
<p>yat tad vapur bhati vibhusanayudhair</p>
<p>avyakta-cid-vyaktam adharayad dharih</p>
<p>babhuva tenaiva sa vamano vatuh</p>
<p>sampasyator divya-gatir yatha natah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord appeared in His original form, with ornaments and weapons in His hands.</p>
<p>Although this ever-existing form is not visible in the material world, He nonetheless appeared in this form.</p>
<p>Then, in the presence of His father and mother, He assumed the form of Vamana, a brahmana-dwarf, a brahmacari, just like a theatrical actor.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word natah is significant.</p>
<p>An actor changes dress to play different parts, but is always the same man.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.33, 39), the Lord assumes many thousands and millions of forms (advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam adyam purana-purusam).</p>
<p>He is always present with innumerable incarnations (ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan nanavataram akarod bhuvanesu kintu (Bs.5.39)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, although He appears in various incarnations, they are not different from one another.</p>
<p>He is the same person, with the same potency, the same eternity and the same spiritual existence, but He can simultaneously assume various forms.</p>
<p>When Vamanadeva appeared from the womb of His mother, He appeared in the form of Narayana, with four hands equipped with the necessary symbolic weapons, and then immediately transformed Himself into a brahmacari (vatu).</p>
<p>This means that His body is not material.</p>
<p>One who thinks that the Supreme Lord assumes a material body is not intelligent.</p>
<p>He has to learn more about the Lord’s position.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah.</p>
<p>One has to understand the transcendental appearance of the Lord in His original transcendental body (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1)).</p>



<p><strong>8.18.13</strong></p>
<p>tam vatum vamanam drstva</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the great sages saw the Lord as the brahmacari-dwarf Vamana, they were certainly very pleased.</p>
<p>Thus they placed before them Kasyapa Muni, the Prajapati, and performed all the ritualistic ceremonies, such as the birthday ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Vedic civilization, when a child is born in the family of a brahmana, the birthday ceremony, known as jata-karma, is first performed, and then other ceremonies are also gradually performed.</p>
<p>But when this vamana-rupa appeared in the form of a vatu, or brahmacari, His sacred thread ceremony was also performed immediately.</p>



<p><strong>8.18.14</strong></p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>

<p>Indeed, He is so powerful that in His full opulence He pressed down the surface of the earth at every step.</p>
