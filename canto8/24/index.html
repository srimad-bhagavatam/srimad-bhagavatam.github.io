<h1>Matsya, the Lord’s Fish Incarnation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.24</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s incarnation as a fish, and it also describes the saving of Maharaja Satyavrata from an inundation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself by svamsa (His personal expansions) and vibhinnamsa (His expansions as the living entities).</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears on this planet for the protection of the sadhus, or devotees, and for the destruction of the miscreants, or nondevotees.</p>
<p>He especially descends to give protection to the cows, the brahmanas, the demigods, the devotees and the Vedic system of religion.</p>
<p>Thus He appears in various forms—sometimes as a fish, sometimes a boar, sometimes Nrsimhadeva, sometimes Vamanadeva and so on—but in any form or incarnation, although He comes within the atmosphere of the material modes of nature, He is unaffected.</p>
<p>This is a sign of His supreme controlling power.</p>
<p>Although He comes within the material atmosphere, maya cannot touch Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, no material qualities can be attributed to Him in any degree.</p>
<p>Once, at the end of the previous kalpa, a demon named Hayagriva wanted to take the Vedic knowledge away from Lord Brahma at the time of annihilation.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead took the incarnation of a fish at the beginning of the period of Svayambhuva Manu and saved the Vedas.</p>
<p>During the reign of Caksusa Manu there was a king named Satyavrata, who was a great pious ruler.</p>
<p>To save him, the Lord appeared as the fish incarnation for a second time.</p>
<p>King Satyavrata later became the son of the sun-god and was known as Sraddhadeva.</p>
<p>He was established as Manu by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>To receive the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Satyavrata engaged in the austerity of subsisting only by drinking water.</p>
<p>Once, while performing this austerity on the bank of the Krtamala River and offering oblations of water with the palm of his hand, he found a small fish.</p>
<p>The fish appealed to the King for protection, asking the King to keep Him in a safe place.</p>
<p>Although the King did not know that the small fish was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, as a king he gave shelter to the fish and kept Him in a water jug.</p>
<p>The fish, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, wanted to show His potency to King Satyavrata, and thus He immediately expanded His body in such a way that He could no longer be kept in the jug of water.</p>
<p>The King then put the fish in a big well, but the well was also too small.</p>
<p>Then the King put the fish in a lake, but the lake was also unsuitable.</p>
<p>Finally the King put the fish in the sea, but even the sea could not accommodate Him.</p>
<p>Thus the King understood that the fish was no one else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he requested the Lord to describe His incarnation as a fish.</p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead, being pleased with the King, informed him that within a week there would be an inundation throughout the universe and that the fish incarnation would protect the King, along with the rsis, herbs, seeds and other living entities, in a boat, which would be attached to the fish’s horn.</p>
<p>After saying this, the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p>King Satyavrata offered respectful obeisances to the Supreme Lord and continued to meditate upon Him.</p>
<p>In due course of time, annihilation took place, and the King saw a boat coming near.</p>
<p>After getting aboard with learned brahmanas and saintly persons, he offered prayers to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, and thus he taught Maharaja Satyavrata and the saintly persons about Vedic knowledge from the core of the heart.</p>
<p>King Satyavrata took his next birth as Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Vivasvan manave praha: the sun-god spoke the science of Bhagavad-gita to his son Manu.</p>
<p>Because of being the son of Vivasvan, this Manu is known as Vaivasvata Manu.</p>
<p>—This commentation has been finished in our New Delhi center today, the first of September, 1976, the day of Radhastami, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the acaryas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is eternally situated in His transcendental position, yet He descends to this material world and manifests Himself in various incarnations.</p>
<p>His first incarnation was that of a great fish.</p>
<p>O most powerful Sukadeva Gosvami, I wish to hear from you the pastimes of that fish incarnation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-powerful, yet He accepted the form of an uncommon fish.</p>
<p>This is one of the ten original incarnations of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat-artham—for what purpose; adadhat—accepted; rupam—form; matsyam—of a fish; loka-jugupsitam—which is certainly not very favorable in this world; tamah—in the mode of ignorance; prakrti—such behavior; durmarsam—which is certainly very painful and condemned; karma-grastah—one who is under the laws of karma; iva—like; isvarah—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; etat—all these facts; nah—unto us; bhagavan—O most powerful sage; sarvam—everything; yathavat—properly; vaktum arhasi—kindly describe; uttamasloka-caritam—the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva-loka-sukha-avaham—by hearing of which everyone becomes happy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>What was the purpose for which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepted the abominable form of a fish, exactly as an ordinary living being accepts different forms under the laws of karma? The form of a fish is certainly condemned and full of terrible pain.</p>
<p>O my lord, what was the purpose of this incarnation? Kindly explain this to us, for hearing about the pastimes of the Lord is auspicious for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja’s question to Sukadeva Gosvami was based on this principle stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):</p>
<p>yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>
<p>tadatmanam srjamy aham</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself The Lord appears in each incarnation to save the world from irreligious principles and especially to protect His devotees (paritranaya sadhunam).</p>
<p>Vamanadeva, for example, appeared to save the devotee Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepted the abominable form of a fish, He must have done so to favor some devotee.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja was eager to know about the devotee for whom the Supreme Lord accepted this form.</p>



<p><strong>8.24.4</strong></p>

<p><strong>8.24.5</strong></p>
<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>go-vipra-sura-sadhunam</p>
<p>chandasam api cesvarah</p>
<p>raksam icchams tanur dhatte</p>
<p>dharmasyarthasya caiva hi</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; go—of the cows; vipra—of the brahmanas; sura—of the demigods; sadhunam—and of the devotees; chandasam api—even of the Vedic literature; ca—and; isvarah—the supreme controller; raksam—the protection; icchan—desiring; tanuh dhatte—accepts the forms of incarnations; dharmasya—of the principles of religion; arthasya—of the principles of the purpose of life; ca—and; eva—indeed; hi—certainly.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King, for the sake of protecting the cows, brahmanas, demigods, devotees, the Vedic literature, religious principles, and principles to fulfill the purpose of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts the forms of incarnations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead generally appears in various types of incarnations to give protection to the cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>The Lord is described as go-brahmana-hitaya ca; in other words, He is always eager to benefit the cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna appeared, He purposefully became a cowherd boy and showed personally how to give protection to the cows and calves.</p>
<p>Similarly, He showed respect to Sudama Vipra, a real brahmana.</p>
<p>From the Lord’s personal activities, human society should learn how to give protection specifically to the brahmanas and cows.</p>
<p>Then the protection of religious principles, fulfillment of the aim of life and protection of Vedic knowledge can be achieved.</p>
<p>Without protection of cows, brahminical culture cannot be maintained; and without brahminical culture, the aim of life cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Lord, therefore, is described as go-brahmana-hitaya because His incarnation is only for the protection of the cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because in Kali-yuga there is no protection of the cows and brahminical culture, everything is in a precarious position.</p>
<p>If human society wants to be exalted, the leaders of society must follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and give protection to the cows, the brahmanas and brahminical culture.</p>



<p><strong>8.24.6</strong></p>
<p>uccavacesu bhutesu</p>
<p>caran vayur ivesvarah</p>
<p>noccavacatvam bhajate</p>
<p>nirgunatvad dhiyo gunaih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ucca-avacesu—having higher or lower bodily forms; bhutesu—among the living entities; caran—behaving; vayuh iva—exactly like the air; isvarah—the Supreme Lord; na—not; ucca-avacatvam—the quality of higher or lower grades of life; bhajate—accepts; nirgunatvat—because of being transcendental, above all material qualities; dhiyah—generally; gunaih—by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Like the air passing through different types of atmosphere, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing sometimes as a human being and sometimes as a lower animal, is always transcendental.</p>
<p>Because He is above the material modes of nature, He is unaffected by higher and lower forms.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of the material nature (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram (Bg.9.10)).</p>
<p>Therefore, being the supreme controller of the laws of nature, the Lord cannot be under their influence.</p>
<p>An example given in this regard is that although the wind blows through many places, the air is not affected by the qualities of these places.</p>
<p>Although the air sometimes carries the odor of a filthy place, the air has nothing to do with such a place.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being all-good and all-auspicious, is never affected by the material qualities like an ordinary living entity purusah prakrti-stho hi bhunkte prakrtijan gunan (Bg.13.21).</p>
<p>When the living entity is in the material nature, he is affected by its qualities.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is not affected.</p>
<p>Disrespectfully, one who does not know this considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead an ordinary living being (avajananti mam mudhah).</p>
<p>Param bhavam ajanantah: such a conclusion is reached by the unintelligent because they are unaware of the transcendental qualities of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p>The Lord assumed one fish incarnation to save the Vedas at the beginning of the Svayambhuva-manvantara, and at the end of the Caksusa-manvantara the Lord again assumed the form of a fish just to favor the great king named Satyavrata.</p>
<p>As there were two incarnations of Varaha, there were also two incarnations of fish.</p>
<p>The Lord appeared as one fish incarnation to save the Vedas by killing Hayagriva, and He assumed the other fish incarnation to show favor to King Satyavrata.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, possessing eyes like the petals of a lotus, the worship of the demigods, who are in the bodily concept of life, is fruitless in all respects.</p>
<p>But because You are the supreme friend and dearmost Supersoul of everyone, worship of Your lotus feet is never useless.</p>
<p>You have therefore manifested Your form as a fish.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods like Indra, Candra and Surya are ordinary living entities who are differentiated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord expands Himself through the living beings (nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam).</p>
<p>His personal visnu-tattva forms, which are all spiritual, are called svamsa, and the living entities who are differentiated parts are called vibhinnamsa.</p>
<p>Some of the vibhinnamsa forms are spiritual, and some are a combination of matter and spirit.</p>
<p>The conditioned souls in the material world are different from their external bodies made of material energy.</p>
<p>Thus the demigods living in the upper planetary systems and the living entities living in the lower planetary system are of the same nature.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those living as human beings on this planet are sometimes attracted to worshiping the demigods in the higher planetary systems.</p>
<p>Such worship is temporary.</p>
<p>As the human beings on this planet have to change their bodies (tatha dehantara-praptih), the living entities known as Indra, Candra, Varuna and so on will also have to change their bodies in due course of time.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: (Bg.7.20) those who do not know the position of the demigods are inclined to worship the demigods for some material purpose, but the results of such worship are never permanent.</p>
<p>Consequently, here it is said, yathetaresam prthag-atmanam satam, padopasarpanam mrsa bhavet.</p>
<p>In other words, if one is to worship someone else, he must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then his worship will never be fruitless.</p>
<p>Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even a slight attempt to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a permanent asset.</p>
<p>Therefore, as recommended in Srimad-Bhagavatam, tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam hareh.</p>
<p>One should take to the worship of the lotus feet of Hari, even if this means giving up the so-called occupational duty assigned because of the particular body one has accepted.</p>
<p>Because worship in terms of the body is temporary, it does not bear any permanent fruit.</p>
<p>But worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives immense benefit.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Pulling the boat, with you and all the rsis in it, O King, I shall travel in the water of devastation until the night of Lord Brahma’s slumber is over.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This particular devastation actually took place not during the night of Lord Brahma but during his day, for it was during the time of Caksusa Manu.</p>
<p>Brahma’s night takes place when Brahma goes to sleep, but in the daytime there are fourteen Manus, one of whom is Caksusa Manu.</p>
<p>Therefore, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that although it was daytime for Lord Brahma, Brahma felt sleepy for a short time by the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>This short period is regarded as Lord Brahma’s night.</p>
<p>This has been elaborately discussed by Srila Rupa Gosvami in his Laghu-bhagavatamrta.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of his analysis.</p>
<p>Because Agastya Muni cursed Svayambhuva Manu, during the time of Svayambhuva Manu a devastation took place.</p>
<p>This devastation is mentioned in the Matsya Purana.</p>
<p>During the time of Caksusa Manu, by the supreme will of the Lord, there was suddenly another pralaya, or devastation.</p>
<p>This is mentioned by Markandeya Rsi in the Visnu-dharmottara.</p>
<p>At the end of Manu’s time there is not necessarily a devastation, but at the end of the Caksusa-manvantara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His illusory energy, wanted to show Satyavrata the effects of devastation.</p>
<p>Srila Sridhara Svami also agrees with this opinion.</p>
<p>The Laghu-bhagavatamrta says:</p>
<p>madhye manvantarasyaiva</p>
<p>muneh sapan manum prati</p>
<p>pralayo ’sau babhuveti</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You will be thoroughly advised and favored by Me, and because of your inquiries, everything about My glories, which are known as param brahma, will be manifest within your heart.</p>
<p>Thus you will know everything about Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, is situated in everyone’s heart, and from Him come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The Lord reveals Himself in proportion to one’s surrender to Him.</p>
<p>Ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham (Bg.4.11).</p>
<p>In responsive cooperation, the Lord reveals Himself in proportion to one’s surrender.</p>
<p>That which is revealed to one who fully surrenders is different from what is revealed to one who surrenders partially.</p>
<p>Everyone naturally surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul surrenders to the laws of nature in material existence, but when one fully surrenders to the Lord, material nature does not act upon him.</p>
<p>Such a fully surrendered soul is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.</p>
<p>Mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te (Bg.7.14).</p>
<p>One who has fully surrendered to the Lord has no fear of the modes of material nature, for everything is but an expansion of the Lord’s glories (sarvam khalv idam brahma), and these glories are gradually revealed and realized.</p>
<p>The Lord is the supreme purifier (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>The more one is purified and the more he wants to know about the Supreme, the more the Lord reveals to him.</p>
<p>Full knowledge of Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan is revealed to the pure devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):</p>
<p>tesam evanukampartham</p>
<p>aham ajnana-jam tamah</p>
<p>nasayamy atma-bhavastho</p>
<p>jnana-dipena bhasvata</p>
<p>Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance</p>

<p>Thus being satisfied, he began offering prayers to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-raja uvaca—the King offered prayers as follows; anadi—from time immemorial; avidya—by ignorance; upahata—has been lost; atma-samvidah—knowledge about the self; tat—that is; mula—the root; samsara—material bondage; parisrama—full of miserable conditions and hard work; aturah—suffering; yadrcchaya—by the supreme will; upasrtah—being favored by the acarya; yam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; apnuyuh—can achieve; vimukti-dah—the process of liberation; nah—our; paramah—the supreme; guruh—spiritual master; bhavan—Your Lordship.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The King said: By the grace of the Lord, those who have lost their self-knowledge since time immemorial, and who because of this ignorance are involved in a material, conditional life full of miseries, obtain the chance to meet the Lord’s devotee.</p>
<p>I accept that Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme spiritual master.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the supreme spiritual master.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord knows everything about the suffering of the conditioned soul, and therefore He appears in this material world, sometimes personally, sometimes by an incarnation and sometimes by authorizing a living being to act on His behalf.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, He is the original spiritual master who enlightens the conditioned souls who are suffering in the material world.</p>
<p>The Lord is always busy helping the conditioned souls in many ways.</p>
<p>Therefore He is addressed here as paramo gurur bhavan.</p>
<p>The representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who acts to spread Krsna consciousness is also guided by the Supreme Lord to act properly in executing the Lord’s order.</p>
<p>Such a person may appear to be an ordinary human being, but because he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual master, he is not to be neglected as ordinary.</p>
<p>It is therefore said, acaryam mam vijaniyat: an acarya who acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be understood to be as good as the Supreme Lord Himself saksad dharitvena samasta-sastrair</p>
<p>uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih</p>
<p>kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya</p>
<p>vande guroh sri-caranaravindam</p>
<p>Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has advised that the spiritual master acting on the Supreme Lord’s behalf must be worshiped as being as good as the Supreme Lord, for he is the Lord’s most confidential servant in broadcasting the Lord’s message for the benefit of the conditioned souls involved in the material world.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>janah—the conditioned soul subjected to birth and death; abudhah—most foolish because of accepting the body as the self; ayam—he; nija-karma-bandhanah—accepting different bodily forms as a result of his sinful activities; sukha-icchaya—desiring to be happy within this material world; karma—fruitive activities; samihate—plans; asukham—but it is for distress only; yat-sevaya—by rendering service unto whom; tam—the entanglement of karma; vidhunoti—clears up; asat-matim—the unclean mentality (accepting the body as the self); granthim—hard knot; sah—His Lordship the Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhindyat—being cut off; hrdayam—in the core of the heart; sah—He (the Lord); nah—our; guruh—the supreme spiritual master.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In hopes of becoming happy in this material world, the foolish conditioned soul performs fruitive activities that result only in suffering.</p>
<p>But by rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one becomes free from such false desires for happiness.</p>
<p>May my supreme spiritual master cut the knot of false desires from the core of my heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>For material happiness, the conditioned soul involves himself in fruitive activities, which actually put him into material distress.</p>
<p>Because the conditioned soul does not know this, he is said to be in avidya, or ignorance.</p>
<p>Because of a false hope for happiness, the conditioned soul becomes involved in various plans for material activity.</p>
<p>Here Maharaja Satyavrata prays that the Lord sever this hard knot of false happiness and thus become his supreme spiritual master.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat-sevaya—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by serving whom; agneh—in touch with fire; iva—as it is; rudra-rodanam—a block of silver or gold becomes purified; puman—a person; vijahyat—can give up; malam—all the dirty things of material existence; atmanah—of one’s self; tamah—the mode of ignorance, by which one performs pious and impious activities; bhajeta—may revive; varnam—his original identity; nijam—one’s own; esah—such; sah—He; avyayah—inexhaustible; bhuyat—let Him become; sah—He; isah—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; paramah—the supreme; guroh guruh—the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious activities.</p>
<p>Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes purified when treated with fire.</p>
<p>May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In human life one is meant to undergo austerity to purify one’s existence.</p>
<p>Tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyet.</p>
<p>Because of contamination by the modes of material nature, one continues in the cycle of birth and death (karanam guna-sango ’sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu).</p>
<p>Therefore the purpose of human life is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>There are various processes for self-realization, such as karma, jnana and yoga, but none of them is equal to the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by performing devotional service (yat-sevaya), but not by karma, jnana or yoga.</p>
<p>Cultivation of speculative knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful.</p>
<p>The word varnam refers to the luster of one’s original identity.</p>
<p>The original luster of gold or silver is brilliant.</p>
<p>Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), is the luster of ananda, or pleasure.</p>
<p>Anandamayo bhyasat.</p>
<p>Every living entity has the right to become anandamaya, joyful, because he is part of the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), Krsna.</p>
<p>Why should the living being be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity should become purified and regain his svarupa, his original identity.</p>
<p>This he can do only by devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as guror guruh, the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</p>
<p>Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord’s representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore gives a definition of guru.</p>
<p>Yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa: (Cc.Madhya 7.128) the bona fide guru is he who advises his disciples exactly in accordance with the principles spoken by Krsna.</p>
<p>The bona fide guru is he who has accepted Krsna as guru.</p>
<p>This is the guru-parampara system.</p>
<p>The original guru is Vyasadeva because he is the speaker of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, wherein everything spoken relates to Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore guru-puja is known as Vyasa-puja.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the original guru is Krsna, His disciple is Narada, whose disciple is Vyasa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the guru-parampara.</p>
<p>One cannot become a guru if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead Krsna or His incarnation wants.</p>
<p>The mission of the guru is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; yat-prasada—of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ayuta-bhaga-lesam—only one ten-thousandth; anye—others; ca—also; devah—even the demigods; guravah—the so-called gurus; janah—the total population; svayam—personally; kartum—to execute; sametah—all together; prabhavanti—can become equally able; pumsah—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tam—unto Him; isvaram—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tvam—unto You; saranam—shelter; prapadye—let me surrender.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Neither all the demigods, nor the so-called gurus nor all other people, either independently or together, can offer mercy that equals even one ten-thousandth of Yours.</p>
<p>Therefore I wish to take shelter of Your lotus feet.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: (Bg.7.20) people in general, being motivated by material desires, worship the demigods to get fruitive results very quickly.</p>
<p>People generally do not become devotees of Lord Visnu, since Lord Visnu never becomes the order-supplier of His devotee.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu does not give a devotee benedictions that will create a further demand for benedictions.</p>
<p>By worshiping the demigods one may get results, but, as described in Bhagavad-gita, antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: whatever great benedictions one may achieve from the demigods are all temporary.</p>
<p>Because the demigods themselves are temporary, their benedictions are also temporary and have no permanent value.</p>
<p>Those who aspire for such benedictions have a poor fund of knowledge (tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam).</p>
<p>The benedictions of Lord Visnu are different.</p>
<p>By the mercy of the Lord Visnu, one can be completely freed from material contamination and go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the benedictions offered by the demigods cannot compare to even one ten-thousandth of the Lord’s benedictions.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, try to obtain benedictions from the demigods or false gurus.</p>
<p>One should aspire only for the benediction offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):</p>
<p>sarva-dharman parityajya</p>
<p>mam ekam saranam vraja</p>
<p>aham tvam sarva-papebhyo</p>
<p>moksayisyami ma sucah</p>
<p>Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.</p>
<p>I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>Do not fear This is the greatest benediction.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As a blind man, being unable to see, accepts another blind man as his leader, people who do not know the goal of life accept someone as a guru who is a rascal and a fool.</p>
<p>But we are interested in self-realization.</p>
<p>Therefore we accept You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as our spiritual master, for You are able to see in all directions and are omniscient like the sun.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The conditioned soul, being wrapped in ignorance and therefore not knowing the goal of life, accepts a guru who can juggle words and make some display of magic that is wonderful to a fool.</p>
<p>Sometimes a foolish person accepts someone as a guru because he can manufacture a small quantity of gold by mystic yogic power.</p>
<p>Because such a disciple has a poor fund of knowledge, he cannot judge whether the manufacture of gold is the criterion for a guru.</p>
<p>Why should one not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, from whom unlimited numbers of gold mines come into being? Aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate (Bg.10.8).</p>
<p>All the gold mines are created by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, why should one accept a magician who can manufacture only a small portion of gold? Such gurus are accepted by those who are blind, not knowing the goal of life.</p>
<p>Maharaja Satyavrata, however, knew the goal of life.</p>
<p>He knew the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he accepted the Lord as his guru.</p>
<p>Either the Supreme Lord or His representative can become guru.</p>
<p>The Lord says, mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te: (Bg.7.14) One can get relief from the clutches of maya as soon as he surrenders unto Me Therefore it is the guru’s business to instruct his disciple to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he wants relief from the material clutches.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of the guru.</p>
<p>This same principle was instructed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa (Cc.Madhya 7.128).</p>
<p>In other words, one is advised not to accept a guru who does not follow the path of instruction given by Lord Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A materialistic so-called guru instructs his materialistic disciples about economic development and sense gratification, and because of such instructions the foolish disciples continue in the materialistic existence of ignorance.</p>
<p>But Your Lordship gives knowledge that is eternal, and the intelligent person receiving such knowledge is quickly situated in his original constitutional position.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>So-called gurus instruct their disciples for the sake of material profit.</p>
<p>Some guru advises that one meditate in such a way that his intelligence will increase in regard to keeping his body fit for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Another guru advises that sex is the ultimate goal of life and that one should therefore engage in sex to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>These are the instructions of foolish gurus.</p>
<p>In other words, because of the instructions of a foolish guru one remains perpetually in material existence and suffers its tribulations.</p>
<p>But if one is intelligent enough to take instructions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as enunciated in Bhagavad-gita or the Sankhya philosophy of Kapiladeva, one can very soon attain liberation and be situated in his original position of spiritual life.</p>
<p>The words nijam padam are significant.</p>
<p>The living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the birthright to a position in Vaikunthaloka, or the spiritual world, where there is no anxiety.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then, as stated in Bhagavad-gita, tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna: (Bg.4.9) after giving up one’s body, one will return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord lives in the spiritual world in His original personality, and a devotee who follows the instructions of the Lord approaches Him (mam eti).</p>
<p>As a spiritual person, such a devotee returns to the Personality of Godhead and plays and dances with Him.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate goal of life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You are the supreme well-wishing friend of everyone, the dearmost friend, the controller, the Supersoul, the supreme instructor and the giver of supreme knowledge and the fulfillment of all desires.</p>
<p>But although You are within the heart, the foolish, because of lusty desires in the heart, cannot understand You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Herein the reason for foolishness is described.</p>
<p>Because the conditioned soul in this material world is full of materialistic lusty desires, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although the Lord is situated in everyone’s heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese’rjuna tisthati (Bg.18.61)).</p>
<p>It is because of this foolishness that one cannot take instructions from the Lord, although the Lord is ready to instruct everyone both externally and internally.</p>
<p>The Lord says, dadami buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te.</p>
<p>In other words, the Lord can give instructions on devotional service by which one can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, people do not take this devotional service.</p>
<p>The Lord, being situated in everyone’s heart, can give one complete instructions on going back to Godhead, but because of lusty desires one engages himself in materialistic activities and does not render service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore one is bereft of the value of the Lord’s instructions.</p>
<p>By mental speculation one can understand that one is not the body but a spirit soul, but unless one engages in devotional service, the real purpose of life is never fulfilled.</p>
<p>The real purpose of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, and live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, play with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, dance with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and eat with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>These are different items of ananda, spiritual happiness in spiritual variegatedness.</p>
<p>Even though one may come to the platform of brahma-bhuta and understand his spiritual identity by speculative knowledge, one cannot enjoy spiritual life without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is indicated here by the word abhista-siddhih.</p>
<p>One can fulfill the ultimate goal of life only by engaging in devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Then the Lord will give one proper instructions on how to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Supreme Lord, for self-realization I surrender unto You, who are worshiped by the demigods as the supreme controller of everything.</p>
<p>By Your instructions, exposing life’s purpose, kindly cut the knot from the core of my heart and let me know the destination of my life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it is argued that people do not know who is a spiritual master and that finding a spiritual master from whom to get enlightenment in regard to the destination of life is very difficult.</p>
<p>To answer all these questions, King Satyavrata shows us the way to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the real spiritual master.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord has given full directions in Bhagavad-gita about how to deal with everything in this material world and how to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should not be misled by so-called gurus who are rascals and fools.</p>
<p>Rather, one should directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the guru or instructor.</p>
<p>It is difficult, however, to understand Bhagavad-gita without the help of the guru.</p>
<p>Therefore the guru appears in the parampara system.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead recommends:</p>
<p>tad viddhi pranipatena</p>
<p>pariprasnena sevaya</p>
<p>upadeksyanti te jnanam</p>
<p>jnaninas tattva-darsinah</p>
<p>Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth Lord Krsna directly instructed Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna is therefore tattva-darsi or guru.</p>
<p>Arjuna accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>Similarly, following in the footsteps of Sri Arjuna, who is a personal devotee of the Lord, one should accept the supremacy of Lord Krsna, as supported by Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Narada and later by the acaryas Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Nimbarka and Visnusvami and still later by the greatest acarya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Where, then, is the difficulty in finding a guru? If one is sincere he can find the guru and learn everything.</p>
<p>One should take lessons from the guru and find out the goal of life.</p>
<p>Maharaja Satyavrata, therefore, shows us the way of the mahajana.</p>
<p>Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah.</p>
<p>One should surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dasavatara) and learn from Him about the spiritual world and the goal of life.</p>

<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who pretended to be a gigantic fish, who restored the Vedic literature to Lord Brahma when Lord Brahma awakened from sleep, and who explained the essence of Vedic literature to King Satyavrata and the great saintly persons.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is a summary of Satyavrata’s meeting with the fish incarnation of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu’s purpose was to take back all the Vedic literatures from the demon Hayagriva and restore them to Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Incidentally, by His causeless mercy, the Lord spoke with Satyavrata.</p>
<p>The word satyavratanam is significant because it indicates that those on the level of Satyavrata can take knowledge from the Vedas delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Lord is accepted as Veda.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, vedanta-krd veda-vit: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the compiler of all Vedic knowledge, and He knows the purport of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who takes knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or from Bhagavad-gita as it is, knows the purpose of the Vedas (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>One cannot understand Vedic knowledge from the veda-vada-ratas, who read the Vedas and misconstrue their subject matter.</p>
<p>One has to know the Vedas from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa janame janame haya, ei abhilasa.</p>
<p>I am attempting to present Srimad-Bhagavatam in the English language by the order of my spiritual master, Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, and by his grace the work of translation is gradually progressing, and the European and American devotees who have joined the Krsna consciousness movement are helping me considerably.</p>
<p>Thus we have expectations of finishing the great task before my passing away.</p>
<p>All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga.</p>
<p>END OF THE EIGHTH CANTO</p>
