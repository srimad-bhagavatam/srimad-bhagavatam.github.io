<h1>King Indra Annihilates the Demons</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.11</strong></p>
<p>As described in this chapter, the great saint Narada Muni, being very compassionate to the demons who had been killed by the demigods, forbade the demigods to continue killing.</p>
<p>Then Sukracarya, by his mystic power, renewed the lives of all the demons.</p>
<p>Having been graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods began fighting the demons again, with renewed energy.</p>
<p>King Indra released his thunderbolt against Bali, and when Bali fell, his friend Jambhasura attacked Indra, who then cut off Jambhasura’s head with his thunderbolt.</p>
<p>When Narada Muni learned that Jambhasura had been killed, he informed Jambhasura’s relatives Namuci, Bala and Paka, who then went to the battlefield and attacked the demigods.</p>
<p>Indra, King of heaven, severed the heads of Bala and Paka and released the weapon known as kulisa, the thunderbolt, against Namuci’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The thunderbolt, however, returned unsuccessful, and thus Indra became morose.</p>
<p>At that time, an unseen voice came from the sky.</p>
<p>The voice declared, A dry or wet weapon cannot kill Namuci Hearing this voice, Indra began to think of how Namuci could be killed.</p>
<p>He then thought of foam, which is neither moist nor dry.</p>
<p>Using a weapon of foam, he was able to kill Namuci.</p>
<p>Thus Indra and the other demigods killed many demons.</p>
<p>Then, at the request of Lord Brahma, Narada went to the demigods and forbade them to kill the demons any longer.</p>
<p>All the demigods then returned to their abodes.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of Narada, whatever demons remained alive on the battlefield took Bali Maharaja to Asta Mountain.</p>
<p>There, by the touch of Sukracarya’s hand, Bali Maharaja regained his senses and consciousness, and those demons whose heads and bodies had not been completely lost were brought back to life by the mystic power of Sukracarya.</p>

<p><strong>8.11.4</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Indra said: O rascal, as a cheater sometimes binds the eyes of a child and takes away his possessions, you are trying to defeat us by displaying some mystic power, although you know that we are the masters of all such mystic powers.</p>



<p><strong>8.11.5</strong></p>
<p>aruruksanti mayabhir</p>
<p>utsisrpsanti ye divam</p>
<p>tan dasyun vidhunomy ajnan</p>
<p>purvasmac ca padad adhah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aruruksanti—persons who desire to come to the upper planeary systems; mayabhih—by so-called mystic power or material advancement of science; utsisrpsanti—or want to be liberated by such false attempts; ye—such persons who; divam—the higher planeary system known as Svargaloka; tan—such rogues and ruffians; dasyun—such thieves; vidhunomi—I force to go down; ajnan—rascals; purvasmat—previous; ca—also; padat—from the position; adhah—downward.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those fools and rascals who want to ascend to the upper planeary system by mystic power or mechanical means, or who endeavor to cross even the upper planes and achieve the spiritual world or liberation, I cause to be sent to the lowest region of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are undoubtedly different planeary systems for different persons.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (14.18), urdhvam gacchanti sattva-sthah: persons in the mode of goodness can go to the upper planes.</p>
<p>Those in the modes of darkness and passion, however, are not allowed to enter the higher planes.</p>
<p>The word divam refers to the higher planeary system known as Svargaloka.</p>
<p>Indra, King of the higher planeary system, has the power to push down any conditioned soul attempting to go from the lower to the higher planes without proper qualifications.</p>
<p>The modern attempt to go to the moon is also an attempt by inferior men to go to Svargaloka by artificial, mechanical means.</p>
<p>This attempt cannot be successful.</p>
<p>From this statement of Indra it appears that anyone attempting to go to the higher planeary systems by mechanical means, which are here called maya, is condemned to go the hellish planes in the lower portion of the universe.</p>
<p>To go to the higher planeary system, one needs sufficient good qualities.</p>
<p>A sinful person situated in the mode of ignorance and addicted to drinking, meat-eating and illicit sex will never enter the higher planes by mechanical means.</p>



<p><strong>8.11.6</strong></p>
<p>so ’ham durmayinas te ’dya</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Today, with my thunderbolt, which has hundreds of sharp edges, I, the same powerful person, shall sever your head from your body.</p>
<p>Although you can produce so much jugglery through illusion, you are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, try to exist on this battlefield with your relatives and friends.</p>



<p><strong>8.11.7</strong></p>
<p>sri-balir uvaca</p>
<p>sangrame vartamananam</p>
<p>kala-codita-karmanam</p>
<p>kirtir jayo ’jayo mrtyuh</p>
<p>sarvesam syur anukramat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-balih uvaca—Bali Maharaja said; sangrame—in the battlefield; vartamananam—of all persons present here; kala-codita—influenced by the course of time; karmanam—for persons engaged in fighting or any other activities; kirtih—reputation; jayah—victory; ajayah—defeat; mrtyuh—death; sarvesam—of all of them; syuh—must be done; anukramat—one after another.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja replied: All those present on this battlefield are certainly under the influence of eternal time, and according to their prescribed activities, they are destined to receive fame, victory, defeat and death, one after another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one is victorious on the battlefield, he becomes famous; and if one is not victorious but is defeated, he may die.</p>
<p>Both victory and defeat are possible, whether on such a battlefield as this or on the battlefield of the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Everything takes place according to the laws of nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Since everyone, without exception, is subject to the modes of material nature, whether one is victorious or defeated he is not independent, but is under the control of material nature.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, therefore, was very sensible.</p>
<p>He knew that the fighting was arranged by eternal time and that under time’s influence one must accept the results of one’s own activities.</p>
<p>Therefore even though Indra threatened that he would now kill Bali Maharaja by releasing the thunderbolt, Bali Maharaja was not at all afraid.</p>
<p>This is the spirit of a ksatriya: yuddhe capy apalayanam (Bg.18.43).</p>
<p>A ksatriya must be tolerant in all circumstances, especially on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Thus Bali Maharaja asserted that he was not at all afraid of death, although he was threatened by such a great personality as the King of heaven.</p>



<p><strong>8.11.8</strong></p>
<p>tad idam kala-rasanam</p>
<p>jagat pasyanti surayah</p>
<p>na hrsyanti na socanti</p>
<p>tatra yuyam apanditah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—therefore; idam—this whole material world; kala-rasanam—is moving because of time eternal; jagat—moving forward (this whole universe); pasyanti—observe; surayah—those who are intelligent by admission of the truth; na—not; hrsyanti—become jubilant; na—nor; socanti—lament; tatra—in such; yuyam—all of you demigods; apanditah—not very learned (having forgotten that you are working under eternal time).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Seeing the movements of time, those who are cognizant of the real truth neither rejoice nor lament for different circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore, because you are jubilant due to your victory, you should be considered not very learned.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja knew that Indra, King of heaven, was extremely powerful, certainly more powerful than he himself.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Bali Maharaja challenged Indra by saying that Indra was not a very learned person.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.11) Krsna rebuked Arjuna by saying:</p>
<p>asocyan anvasocas tvam</p>
<p>prajna-vadams ca bhasase</p>
<p>gatasun agatasums ca</p>
<p>nanusocanti panditah</p>
<p>While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief.</p>
<p>Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead Thus as Krsna challenged Arjuna by saying that he was not a pandita, or a learned person, Bali Maharaja also challenged King Indra and his associates.</p>
<p>In this material world, everything happens under the influence of time.</p>
<p>Consequently, for a learned person who sees how things are taking place, there is no question of being sorry or happy because of the waves of material nature.</p>
<p>After all, since we are being carried away by these waves, what is the meaning of being jubilant or morose? One who is fully conversant with the laws of nature is never jubilant or morose because of nature’s activities.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.14), Krsna advises that one be tolerant: tams titiksasva bharata.</p>
<p>Following this advice of Krsna’s, one should not be morose or unhappy because of circumstantial changes.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of a devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee carries out his duty in Krsna consciousness and is never unhappy in awkward circumstances.</p>
<p>He has full faith that in such circumstances, Krsna protects His devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore a devotee never deviates from his prescribed duty of devotional service.</p>
<p>The material qualities of jubilation and moroseness are present even in the demigods, who are very highly situated in the upper planeary system.</p>
<p>Therefore, when one is undisturbed by the so-called favorable and unfavorable circumstances of this material world, he should be understood to be brahma-bhuta, or self-realized.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.54), brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati: One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful When one is undisturbed by material circumstances, he should be understood to be on the transcendental stage, above the reactions of the three modes of material nature.</p>

<p>atmanam tatra sadhanam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You demigods think that your own selves are the cause of your attaining fame and victory.</p>
<p>Because of your ignorance, saintly persons feel sorry for you.</p>
<p>Therefore, although your words afflict the heart, we do not accept them.</p>
