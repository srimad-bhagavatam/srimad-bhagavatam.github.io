<h1><a class="header" href="#the-demigods-appeal-to-the-lord-for-protection" id="the-demigods-appeal-to-the-lord-for-protection">The Demigods Appeal to the Lord for Protection</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#85" id="85">8.5</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the fifth and sixth Manus, and it also describes the prayers of the demigods and the curse of Durvasa Muni.</p>
<p>The brother of Tamasa, the fourth Manu, who has previously been described, was the fifth Manu, Raivata.</p>
<p>The sons of Raivata included Arjuna, Bali and Vindhya.</p>
<p>During the reign of this Manu, Indra, the King of heaven, was known as Vibhu.</p>
<p>Among the demigods were the Bhutarayas, and among the seven rsis were Hiranyaroma, Vedasira and Urdhvabahu.</p>
<p>The rsi known as Subhra, by his wife, Vikuntha, gave birth to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vaikuntha.</p>
<p>This Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested a Vaikuntha planet at the request of Ramadevi.</p>
<p>His power and activities are mentioned in the Third Canto.</p>
<p>The sixth Manu was Caksusa, the son of Caksu Manu.</p>
<p>Among the sons of the sixth Manu were Puru, Purusa and Sudyumna.</p>
<p>During the reign of this Manu, Mantradruma was Indra, the King of the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Among the demigods were the Apyas, and among the seven rsis were Havisman and Viraka.</p>
<p>The wife of Vairaja, whose name was Devasambhuti, gave birth to Ajita, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This Ajita, taking the shape of a tortoise and holding the mountain known as Mandara on His back, churned the ocean and produced nectar for the demigods.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit was very eager to hear about the churning of the ocean, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami began to explain to him how the demigods, having been cursed by Durvasa Muni, were defeated in battle by the asuras.</p>
<p>When the demigods were deprived of their heavenly kingdom, they went to the assembly house of Lord Brahma and informed Lord Brahma of what had happened.</p>
<p>Then Brahma, along with all the demigods, went to the shore of the ocean of milk and offered prayers to Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>
