<h1>Bali Maharaja Arrested by the Lor</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.21</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Visnu, desiring to advertise the glories of Bali Maharaja, arrested him for not fulfilling his promise in regard to the Lord’s third step.</p>
<p>With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost plane of the universe, Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails.</p>
<p>Thus Lord Brahma, accompanied by great sages like Marici and the predominating deities of all the higher planes, offered humble prayers and worship to the Lord.</p>
<p>They washed the Lord’s feet and worshiped Him with all paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Rksaraja, Jambavan, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry.</p>
<p>Although Bali Maharaja warned them not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>All of them were defeated, however, by Lord Visnu’s eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Maharaja’s order, they all entered the lower planes of the universe.</p>
<p>Understanding Lord Visnu’s purpose, Garuda, the carrier of Lord Visnu, immediately arrested Bali Maharaja with the ropes of Varuna.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja was thus reduced to a helpless position, Lord Visnu asked him for the third step of land.</p>
<p>Because Lord Visnu appreciated Bali Maharaja’s determination and integrity, when Bali Maharaja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Visnu ascertained that the place for him would be the plane Sutala, which is better than the planes of heaven.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: When Lord Brahma, who was born of a lotus flower, saw that the effulgence of his residence, Brahmaloka, had been reduced by the glaring effulgence from the toenails of Lord Vamanadeva, he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma was accompanied by all the great sages, headed by Marici, and by yogis like Sanandana, but in the presence of that glaring effulgence, O King, even Lord Brahma and his associates seemed insignificant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Among the great personalities who came to worship the lotus feet of the Lord were those who had attained perfection in self-control and regulative principles, as well as experts in logic, history, general education and the Vedic literature known as kalpe (dealing with old historical incidents).</p>
<p>Others were experts in the Vedic corollaries like Brahma-samhita, all the other knowledge of the Vedas (Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva), and also the supplementary Vedic knowledge (Ayur-veda, Dhanur-veda, etc.).</p>
<p>Others were those who had been freed of the reactions to fruitive activities by transcendental knowledge awakened by practice of yoga.</p>
<p>And still others were those who had attained residence in Brahmaloka not by ordinary karma but by advanced Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>After devotedly worshiping the upraised lotus feet of the Supreme Lord with oblations of water, Lord Brahma, who was born of the lotus emanating from Lord Visnu’s navel, offered prayers to the Lord.</p>

<p>dhatuh kamandalu-jalam tad urukramasya</p>
<p>padavanejana-pavitrataya narendra</p>
<p>svardhuny abhun nabhasi sa patati nimarsti</p>
<p>loka-trayam bhagavato visadeva kirtih</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, the water from Lord Brahma’s kamandalu washed the lotus feet of Lord Vamanadeva, who is known as Urukrama, the wonderful actor.</p>
<p>Thus that water became so pure that it was transformed into the water of the Ganges, which went flowing down from the sky, purifying the three worlds like the pure fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here we understand that the Ganges began when the water from Lord Brahma’s kamandalu washed the lotus feet of Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>But in the Fifth Canto it is stated that the Ganges began when Vamanadeva’s left foot pierced the covering of the universe so that the transcendental water of the Causal Ocean leaked through.</p>
<p>And elsewhere it is also stated that Lord Narayana appeared as the water of the Ganges.</p>
<p>The water of the Ganges, therefore, is a combination of three transcendental waters, and thus the Ganges is able to purify the three worlds.</p>
<p>This is the description given by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma and all the predominating deities of the various planeary systems began to worship Lord Vamanadeva, their supreme master, who had reduced Himself from His all-pervading form to His original form.</p>
<p>They collected all the ingredients and paraphernalia for this worship.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vamanadeva first expanded Himself to the universal form and then reduced Himself to the original Vamana-rupa.</p>
<p>Thus He acted exactly like Lord Krsna, who, at the request of Arjuna, first showed His universal form and later resumed His original form as Krsna.</p>
<p>The Lord can assume any form He likes, but His original form is that of Krsna (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam).</p>
<p>According to the capacity of the devotee, the Lord assumes various forms so that the devotee can handle Him.</p>
<p>This is His causeless mercy.</p>
<p>When Lord Vamanadeva resumed His original form, Lord Brahma and his associates collected various paraphernalia for worship with which to please Him.</p>

<p>O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vamanadeva, then spoke to Bali Maharaja, the most liberal and celebrated personality whom He had arrested with the ropes of Varuna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When one is bereft of all his possessions, he is certainly reduced in bodily luster.</p>
<p>But although Bali Maharaja had lost everything, he was fixed in his determination to satisfy Vamanadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>A pure devotee is never deviated from the service of the Lord, despite all difficulties and impediments offered by the illusory energy.</p>
<p>Generally men who have wealth and opulence are famous, but Bali Maharaja became famous for all time by being deprived of all his possessions.</p>
<p>This is the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead toward His devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord says, yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih.</p>
<p>As the first installment of His special favor, the Lord takes away all the possessions of His devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee, however, is never disturbed by such a loss.</p>
<p>He continues his service, and the Lord amply rewards him, beyond the expectations of any common man.</p>

<p>bhurlokah kham disas tanoh</p>

<p>And in your presence, with My second step, I have occupied the upper planeary system.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic description of the planeary system, all the planes move from east to west.</p>
<p>The sun, the moon and five other planes, such as Mars and Jupiter, orbit one above another.</p>
<p>Vamanadeva, however, expanding His body and extending His steps, occupied the entire planeary system.</p>



<p><strong>8.21.32</strong></p>
<p>pratisrutam adatus te</p>
<p>niraye vasa isyate</p>
<p>visa tvam nirayam tasmad</p>

<p>Because you have been unable to give charity according to your promise, the rule is that you should go down to live in the hellish planes.</p>
<p>Therefore, in accordance with the order of Sukracarya, your spiritual master, now go down and live there.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said:</p>
<p>narayana-parah sarve</p>
<p>na kutascana bibhyati</p>
<p>svargapavarga-narakesv</p>
<p>api tulyartha-darsinah</p>
<p>Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, never fear any condition of life.</p>
<p>For them the heavenly planes, liberation and the hellish planes are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord (Bhag.6.12.28) A devotee engaged in the service of Narayana is always in equilibrium.</p>
<p>A devotee actually lives transcendentally.</p>
<p>Although he may appear to have gone to hell or heaven, he does not live in either place; rather, he always lives in Vaikuntha (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg.14.26)).</p>
<p>Vamanadeva asked Bali Maharaja to go to the hellish planes, apparently just to show the entire universe how tolerant he was, and Bali Maharaja did not hesitate to carry out the order.</p>
<p>A devotee does not live alone.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because the devotee is engaged in His service, he actually does not live in any material condition.</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, kita janma hao yatha tuya dasa.</p>
<p>Thus he prays to take birth as an insignificant insect in the association of devotees.</p>
<p>Because devotees are engaged in the service of the Lord, anyone who lives with them also lives in Vaikuntha.</p>



<p><strong>8.21.33</strong></p>
<p>vrtha manorathas tasya</p>
<p>durah svargah pataty adhah</p>
<p>pratisrutasyadanena</p>
<p>yo ’rthinam vipralambhate</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vrtha—without any good result; manorathah—mental concoction; tasya—of him; durah—far away; svargah—elevation to the higher planeary system; patati—falls down; adhah—to a hellish condition of life; pratisrutasya—things promised; adanena—being unable to give; yah—anyone who; arthinam—a beggar; vipralambhate—cheats.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Far from being elevated to the heavenly planes or fulfilling one’s desire, one who does not properly give a beggar what he has promised falls down to a hellish condition of life.</p>



<p><strong>8.21.34</strong></p>
<p>vipralabdho dadamiti</p>
<p>tvayaham cadhya-manina</p>
<p>tad vyalika-phalam bhunksva</p>
<p>nirayam katicit samah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vipralabdhah—now I am cheated; dadami—I promise I shall give you; iti—thus; tvaya—by you; aham—I am; ca—also; adhya-manina—by being very proud of your opulence; tat—therefore; vyalika-phalam—as a result of cheating; bhunksva—you enjoy; nirayam—in hellish life; katicit—a few; samah—years.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Being falsely proud of your possessions, you promised to give Me land, but you could not fulfill your promise.</p>
<p>Therefore, because your promise was false, you must live for a few years in hellish life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The false prestige of thinking I am very rich, and I possess such vast propert is another side of material life.</p>
<p>Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else possesses anything.</p>
<p>This is the real fact.</p>
<p>Isavasyam idam samam yat kinca jagatyam jagat.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was undoubtedly the most exalted devotee, whereas previously he had maintained a misunderstanding due to false prestige.</p>
<p>By the supreme will of the Lord, he now had to go to the hellish planes, but because he went there by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he lived there more opulently than one could expect to live in the planes of heaven.</p>
<p>A devotee always lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, engaging in His service, and therefore he is always transcendental to hellish or heavenly residences.</p>
