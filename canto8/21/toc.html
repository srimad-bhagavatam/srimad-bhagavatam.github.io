<h1><a class="header" href="#bali-maharaja-arrested-by-the-lor" id="bali-maharaja-arrested-by-the-lor">Bali Maharaja Arrested by the Lor</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#821" id="821">8.21</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Visnu, desiring to advertise the glories of Bali Maharaja, arrested him for not fulfilling his promise in regard to the Lord’s third step.</p>
<p>With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost planet of the universe, Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails.</p>
<p>Thus Lord Brahma, accompanied by great sages like Marici and the predominating deities of all the higher planets, offered humble prayers and worship to the Lord.</p>
<p>They washed the Lord’s feet and worshiped Him with all paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Rksaraja, Jambavan, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry.</p>
<p>Although Bali Maharaja warned them not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>All of them were defeated, however, by Lord Visnu’s eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Maharaja’s order, they all entered the lower planets of the universe.</p>
<p>Understanding Lord Visnu’s purpose, Garuda, the carrier of Lord Visnu, immediately arrested Bali Maharaja with the ropes of Varuna.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja was thus reduced to a helpless position, Lord Visnu asked him for the third step of land.</p>
<p>Because Lord Visnu appreciated Bali Maharaja’s determination and integrity, when Bali Maharaja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Visnu ascertained that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: When Lord Brahma, who was born of a lotus flower, saw that the effulgence of his residence, Brahmaloka, had been reduced by the glaring effulgence from the toenails of Lord Vamanadeva, he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma was accompanied by all the great sages, headed by Marici, and by yogis like Sanandana, but in the presence of that glaring effulgence, O King, even Lord Brahma and his associates seemed insignificant.</p>
