<h1><a class="header" href="#the-demigods-and-demons-declare-a-truce" id="the-demigods-and-demons-declare-a-truce">The Demigods and Demons Declare a Truce</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#86" id="86">8.6</a></strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how the Lord appeared before the demigods when they offered Him their prayers.</p>
<p>Following the advice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods executed a truce with the demons for the purpose of churning nectar from the sea.</p>
<p>Because of the prayers offered by the demigods in the previous chapter, Lord Ksirodakasayi Visnu was pleased with the demigods, and thus He appeared before them.</p>
<p>The demigods were almost blinded by His transcendental bodily effulgence.</p>
<p>At first, therefore, they could not even see any part of His body.</p>
<p>After some time, however, when Brahma could see the Lord, he, along with Lord Siva, began to offer the Lord prayers.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being beyond birth and death, is eternal.</p>
<p>He has no material qualities.</p>
<p>Yet He is the ocean of unlimited auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>He is subtler than the most subtle, He is invisible, and His form is inconceivable.</p>
<p>He is worshipable for all the demigods.</p>
<p>Innumerable universes exist within His form, and therefore He is never separated from these universes by time, space or circumstances.</p>
<p>He is the chief and the pradhana.</p>
<p>Although He is the beginning, the middle and the end of the material creation, the idea of pantheism conceived by Mayavadi philosophers has no validity.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the entire material manifestation through His subordinate agent, the external energy.</p>
<p>Because of His inconceivable transcendental position, He is always the master of the material energy.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His various forms, is always present even within this material world, but the material qualities cannot touch Him.</p>
<p>One can understand His position only by His instructions, as given in Bhagavad-gita As stated in Bhagavad-gita (10.10), dadami buddhi-yogam tam.</p>
<p>Buddhi-yoga means bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Only through the process of bhakti-yoga can one understand the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When offered prayers by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased.</p>
<p>Thus He gave appropriate instructions to all the demigods.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Ajita, unconquerable, advised the demigods to make a peace proposal to the demons, so that after formulating a truce, the demigods and demons could churn the ocean of milk.</p>
<p>The rope would be the biggest serpent, known as Vasuki, and the churning rod would be Mandara Mountain.</p>
<p>Poison would also be produced from the churning, but it would be taken by Lord Siva, and so there would be no need to fear it.</p>
<p>Many other attractive things would be generated by the churning, but the Lord warned the demigods not to be captivated by such things.</p>
<p>Nor should the demigods be angry if there were some disturbances.</p>
<p>After advising the demigods in this way, the Lord disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods established a peace with Maharaja Bali, the King of the demons.</p>
<p>Then both the demons and the demigods started for the ocean, taking Mandara Mountain with them.</p>
<p>Because of the great heaviness of the mountain, the demigods and demons became fatigued, and some of them actually died.</p>
<p>Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, appeared there on the back of His carrier, Garuda, and by His mercy He brought these demigods and demons back to life.</p>
<p>The Lord then lifted the mountain with one of His hands and placed it on the back of Garuda.</p>
<p>The Lord sat on the mountain and was carried to the spot of the churning by Garuda, who placed the mountain in the middle of the sea.</p>
<p>Then the Lord asked Garuda to leave that place because as long as Garuda was present, Vasuki could not come there.</p>
