<h1>The Churning of the Milk Ocean</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.8</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how the goddess of fortune appeared during the churning of the ocean of milk and how she accepted Lord Visnu as her husband.</p>
<p>As described later in the chapter, when Dhanvantari appeared with a pot of nectar the demons immediately snatched it from him, but Lord Visnu appeared as the incarnation Mohini, the most beautiful woman in the world, just to captivate the demons and save the nectar for the demigods.</p>
<p>After Lord Siva drank all the poison, both the demigods and demons took courage and resumed their activities of churning.</p>
<p>Because of this churning, first a surabhi cow was produced.</p>
<p>Great saintly persons accepted this cow to derive clarified butter from its milk and offer this clarified butter in oblations for great sacrifices.</p>
<p>Thereafter, a horse named Uccaihsrava was generated.</p>
<p>This horse was taken by Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Then there appeared Airavata and other elephants that could go anywhere in any direction, and she-elephants also appeared.</p>
<p>The gem known as Kaustubha was also generated, and Lord Visnu took that gem and placed it on His chest.</p>
<p>Thereafter, a parijata flower and the Apsaras, the most beautiful women in the universe, were generated.</p>
<p>Then the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, appeared.</p>
<p>The demigods, great sages, Gandharvas and others offered her their respectful worship.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune could not find anyone to accept as her husband.</p>
<p>At last she selected Lord Visnu to be her master.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu gave her a place to stay everlastingly at His chest.</p>
<p>Because of this combination of Laksmi and Narayana, all who were present, including the demigods and people in general, were very pleased.</p>
<p>The demons, however, being neglected by the goddess of fortune, were very depressed.</p>
<p>Then Varuni, the goddess of drinking, was generated, and by the order of Lord Visnu the demons accepted her.</p>
<p>Then the demons and demigods, with renewed energy, began to churn again.</p>
<p>This time a partial incarnation of Lord Visnu called Dhanvantari appeared.</p>
<p>He was very beautiful, and he carried a jug containing nectar.</p>
<p>The demons immediately snatched the jug from Dhanvantari’s hand and began to run away, and the demigods, being very morose, took shelter of Visnu.</p>
<p>After the demons snatched the jug from Dhanvantari, they began to fight among themselves.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu solaced the demigods, who therefore did not fight, but remained silent.</p>
<p>While the fighting was going on among the demons, the Lord Himself appeared as the incarnation Mohini, the most beautiful woman in the universe.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; pite—was drunk; gare—when the poison; vrsa-ankena—by Lord Siva, who sits on a bull; pritah—being pleased; te—all of them; amara—the demigods; danavah—and the demons; mamanthuh—again began to churn; tarasa—with great force; sindhum—the ocean of milk; havirdhani—the surabhi cow, who is the source of clarified butter; tatah—from that churning; abhavat—was generated.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Upon Lord Siva’s drinking the poison, both the demigods and the demons, being very pleased, began to churn the ocean with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>As a result of this, there appeared a cow known as surabhi.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The surabhi cow is described as havirdhani, the source of butter.</p>
<p>Butter, when clarified by melting, produces ghee, or clarified butter, which is inevitably necessary for performing great ritualistic sacrifices.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18 5), yajna-dana-tapah-karma na tyajyam karyam eva tat: sacrifice, charity and austerity are essential to keep human society perfect in peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Yajna, the performance of sacrifice, is essential; to perform yajna, clarified butter is absolutely necessary; and to get clarified butter, milk is necessary.</p>
<p>Milk is produced when there are sufficient cows.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), cow protection is recommended (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhava jam).</p>



<p><strong>8.8.2</strong></p>
<p>tam agni-hotrim rsayo</p>
<p>jagrhur brahma-vadinah</p>
<p>yajnasya deva-yanasya</p>
<p>medhyaya havise nrpa</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tam—that cow; agni-hotrim—absolutely necessary for the production of yogurt, milk and ghee to offer as oblations in the fire; rsayah—sages who perform such sacrifices; jagrhuh—took in charge; brahma-vadinah—because such sages know the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies; yajnasya—of sacrifice; deva-yanasya—which fulfills the desire to be elevated to the higher planeary systems and to Brahmaloka; medhyaya—fit for offering oblations; havise—for the sake of pure clarified butter; nrpa—O King.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, great sages who were completely aware of the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies took charge of that surabhi cow, which produced all the yogurt, milk and ghee absolutely necessary for offering oblations into the fire.</p>
<p>They did this just for the sake of pure ghee, which they wanted for the performance of sacrifices to elevate themselves to the higher planeary systems, up to Brahmaloka.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Surabhi cows are generally found on the Vaikuntha planes.</p>
<p>As described in Brahma-samhita, Lord Krsna, on His plane, Goloka Vrndavana, engages in tending the surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam (Bs.5.29)).</p>
<p>These cows are the Lord’s pet animals.</p>
<p>From the surabhi cows one can take as much milk as one needs, and one may milk these cows as many times as he desires.</p>
<p>In other words, the surabhi cow can yield milk unlimitedly.</p>
<p>Milk is necessary for the performance of yajna.</p>
<p>Sages know how to use milk to elevate human society to the perfection of life.</p>
<p>Since cow protection is recommended everywhere in the sastras, the brahma vadis took charge of the surabhi cow, in which the demons were not very interested.</p>

<p>Generated next was the parijata flower, which decorates the celestial planes.</p>
<p>O King, as you fulfill the desires of everyone on this plane by fulfilling all ambitions, the parijata fulfills the desires of everyone.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.7</strong></p>

<p>Next there appeared the Apsaras (who are used as prostitutes on the heavenly planes).</p>
<p>They were fully decorated with golden ornaments and lockets and were dressed in fine and attractive clothing.</p>
<p>The Apsaras move very slowly in an attractive style that bewilders the inhabitants of the heavenly planes.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.8</strong></p>
<p>tatas cavirabhut saksac</p>
<p>chri rama bhagavat-para</p>
<p>ranjayanti disah kantya</p>
<p>vidyut saudamani yatha</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatah—thereafter; ca—and; avirabhut—manifested; saksat—directly; sri—the goddess of fortune; rama—known as Rama; bhagavat-para—absolutely inclined to be possessed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ranjayanti—illuminating; disah—all directions; kantya—by luster; vidyut—lightning; saudamani—Saudamani; yatha—as.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then there appeared the goddess of fortune, Rama, who is absolutely dedicated to being enjoyed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>She appeared like electricity, surpassing the lightning that might illuminate a marble mountain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri means opulence.</p>
<p>Krsna is the owner of all opulences bhoktaram yajna-tapasam</p>
<p>sarva-loka-mahesvaram</p>
<p>suhrdam sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>jnatva mam santim rcchati</p>
<p>This peace formula for the world is given in Bhagavad-gita (5.29).</p>
<p>When people know that the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor and the most intimate well-wishing friend of all living entities, peace and prosperity will ensue all over the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the conditioned souls, being placed into illusion by the external energy of the Lord, want to fight with one another, and therefore peace is disturbed.</p>
<p>The first prerequisite for peace is that all the wealth presented by Sri, the goddess of fortune, be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Everyone should give up his false proprietorship over worldly possessions and offer everything to Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the teaching of the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.9</strong></p>
<p>tasyam cakruh sprham sarve</p>
<p>sasurasura-manavah</p>
<p>rupaudarya-vayo-varna-</p>
<p>mahimaksipta-cetasah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasyam—unto her; cakruh—did; sprham—desire; sarve—everyone; sa-sura-asura-manavah—the demigods, the demons and the human beings; rupa-audarya—by the exquisite beauty and bodily features; vayah—youth; varna—complexion; mahima—glories; aksipta—agitated; cetasah—their minds.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of her exquisite beauty, her bodily features, her youth, her complexion and her glories, everyone, including the demigods, the demons and the human beings, desired her.</p>
<p>They were attracted because she is the source of all opulences.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Who in this world does not want to possess wealth, beauty and the social respectability that come from these opulences? People generally desire material enjoyment, material opulence and the association of aristocratic family members (bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam).</p>
<p>Material enjoyment entails money, beauty and the reputation they bring, which can all be achieved by the mercy of the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, however, never remains alone.</p>
<p>As indicated in the previous verse by the word bhagavat-para, she is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is enjoyable only by Him.</p>
<p>If one wants the favor of the goddess of fortune, mother Laksmi, because she is by nature bhagavat-para one must keep her with Narayana.</p>
<p>The devotees who always engage in the service of Narayana (narayana-parayana) can easily achieve the favor of the goddess of fortune without a doubt, but materialists who try to get the favor of the goddess of fortune only to possess her for personal enjoyment are frustrated.</p>
<p>Theirs is not a good policy.</p>
<p>The celebrated demon Ravana, for example, wanted to deprive Ramacandra of Laksmi, Sita, and thus be victorious, but the result was just the opposite.</p>
<p>Sita, of course, was taken by force by Lord Ramacandra, and Ravana and his entire material empire were vanquished.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune is desirable for everyone, including human beings, but one should understand that the goddess of fortune is the exclusive property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One cannot achieve the mercy of the goddess of fortune unless one prays both to her and to the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.10</strong></p>
<p>tasya asanam aninye</p>
<p>mahendro mahad-adbhutam</p>
<p>murtimatyah saric-chrestha</p>
<p>hema-kumbhair jalam suci</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasyah—for her; asanam—a sitting place; aninye—brought; maha-indrah—the King of heaven, Indra; mahat—glorious; adbhutam—wonderful; murti-matyah—accepting forms; sarit-sresthah—the best of various sacred waters; hema—golden; kumbhaih—with waterpots; jalam—water; suci—pure.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The King of heaven, Indra, brought a suitable sitting place for the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>All the rivers of sacred water, such as the Ganges and Yamuna, personified themselves, and each of them brought pure water in golden waterpots for mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.11</strong></p>
<p>abhisecanika bhumir</p>
<p>aharat sakalausadhih</p>
<p>gavah panca pavitrani</p>
<p>vasanto madhu-madhavau</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>abhisecanikah—paraphernalia required for installing the Deity; bhumih—the land; aharat—collected; sakala—all kinds of; ausadhih—drugs and herbs; gavah—the cows; panca—five different varieties of products from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, clarified butter, cow dung and cow urine; pavitrani—uncontaminated; vasantah—personified springtime; madhu-madhavau—flowers and fruits produced during spring, or in the months of Caitra and Vaisakha.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The land became a person and collected all the drugs and herbs needed for installing the Deity.</p>
<p>The cows delivered five products, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, urine and cow dung, and spring personified collected everything produced in spring, during the months of Caitra and Vaisakha (April and May).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Panca-gavya, the five products received from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, cow dung and cow urine, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic directions.</p>
<p>Cow urine and cow dung are uncontaminated, and since even the urine and dung of a cow are important, we can just imagine how important this animal is for human civilization.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, directly advocates go-raksya, the protection of cows.</p>
<p>Civilized men who follow the system of varnasrama, especially those of the vaisya class, who engage in agriculture and trade, must give protection to the cows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because people in Kali-yuga are mandah, all bad, and sumanda-matayah, misled by false conceptions of life, they are killing cows in the thousands.</p>
<p>Therefore they are unfortunate in spiritual consciousness, and nature disturbs them in so many ways, especially through incurable diseases like cancer and through frequent wars and among nations.</p>
<p>As long as human society continues to allow cows to be regularly killed in slaughterhouses, there cannot be any question of peace and prosperity.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.12</strong></p>

<p>The great sages performed the bathing ceremony of the goddess of fortune as directed in the authorized scriptures, the Gandharvas chanted all-auspicious Vedic mantras, and the professional women dancers very nicely danced and sang authorized songs prescribed in the Vedas.</p>

<p>The clouds in personified form beat various types of drums, known as mrdangas, panavas, murajas and anakas.</p>
<p>They also blew conchshells and bugles known as gomukhas and played flutes and stringed instruments.</p>
<p>The combined sound of these instruments was tumultuous.</p>

<p>tatah—thereafter; abhisisicuh—poured all-auspicious water on the body; devim—the goddess of fortune; sriyam—very beautiful; padma-karam—with a lotus in her hand; satim—she who is most chaste, not knowing anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead; digibhah—the great elephants; purna-kalasaih—by completely full water jugs; sukta-vakyaih—with Vedic mantras; dvi-ja—by brahmanas; iritaih—chanted.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, the great elephants from all the directions carried big water jugs full of Ganges water and bathed the goddess of fortune, to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras chanted by learned brahmanas.</p>
<p>While thus being bathed, the goddess of fortune maintained her original style, with a lotus flower in her hand, and she appeared very beautiful.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune is the most chaste, for she does not know anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is described in this verse as sriyam, which means that she has six opulences—wealth, strength, influence, beauty, knowledge and renunciation.</p>
<p>These opulences are received from the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>Laksmi is addressed here as devi, the goddess, because in Vaikuntha she supplies all opulences to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, who in this way enjoy natural life in the Vaikuntha planes.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with His consort, the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand.</p>
<p>Mother Laksmi is described in this verse as sati, the supremely chaste, because she never diverts her attention from the Supreme Personality of Godhead to anyone else.</p>

<p>The ocean, which is the source of all valuable jewels, supplied the upper and lower portions of a yellow silken garment.</p>
<p>The predominating deity of the water, Varuna, presented flower garlands surrounded by six-legged bumblebees, drunken with honey.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When bathing the Deity in the abhiseka ceremony with various liquids, such as milk, honey, yogurt, ghee, cow dung and cow urine, it is customary to supply yellow garments.</p>
<p>In this way the abhiseka ceremony for the goddess of fortune was performed according to the regular Vedic principles.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>stana-dvayam—her two breasts; ca—also; ati-krsa-udari—the middle portion of her body being very thin; samam—equally; nirantaram—constantly; candana-kunkuma—with sandalwood pulp and kunkuma, a reddish powder; uksitam—smeared; tatah tatah—here and there; nupura—of ankle bells; valgu—very beautiful; sinjitaih—with the light resounding; visarpati—walking; hema-lata—a golden creeper; iva—exactly like; sa—the goddess of fortune; babhau—appeared.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p>padam dhruvam cavyabhicari-sad-gunam</p>
<p>gandharva-siddhasura-yaksa-carana-</p>
<p>traipistapeyadisu nanvavindata</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>vilokayanti—observing, examining; niravadyam—without any fault; atmanah—for herself; padam—position; dhruvam—eternal; ca—also; avyabhicari-sat-gunam—without any change of qualities; gandharva—among the inhabitants of Gandharvaloka; siddha—the inhabitants of Siddhaloka; asura—the demons; yaksa—the Yaksas; carana—the inhabitants of Caranaloka; traipistapeya-adisu—and among the demigods; na—not; anvavindata—could accept any one of them.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While walking among the Gandharvas, Yaksas, asuras, Siddhas, Caranas and denizens of heaven, Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, was scrutinizingly examining them, but she could not find anyone naturally endowed with all good qualities.</p>
<p>None of them was devoid of faults, and therefore she could not take shelter of any of them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, Laksmidevi, having been generated from the ocean of milk, was the daughter of the ocean.</p>
<p>Thus she was allowed to select her own husband in a svayamvara ceremony.</p>
<p>She examined every one of the candidates, but she could not find anyone suitably qualified to be her shelter.</p>
<p>In other words, Narayana, the natural husband of Laksmi, cannot be superseded by anyone in this material world.</p>



<p><strong>8.8.20</strong></p>
<p>nunam tapo yasya na manyu-nirjayo</p>
<p>jnanam kvacit tac ca na sanga-varjitam</p>
<p>kascin mahams tasya na kama-nirjayah</p>
<p>sa isvarah kim parato vyapasrayah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nunam—certainly; tapah—austerity; yasya—of someone; na—not; manyu—anger; nirjayah—conquered; jnanam—knowledge; kvacit—in some saintly person; tat—that; ca—also; na—not; sanga-varjitam—without the contamination of association; kascit—someone; mahan—a very great exalted person; tasya—his; na—not; kama—material desires; nirjayah—conquered; sah—such a person; isvarah—controller; kim—how can he be; paratah—of others; vyapasrayah—under the control.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, examining the assembly, thought in this way: Someone who has undergone great austerity has not yet conquered anger.</p>
<p>Someone possesses knowledge, but he has not conquered material desires.</p>
<p>Someone is a very great personality, but he cannot conquer lusty desires.</p>
<p>Even a great personality depends on something else.</p>
<p>How, then, can he be the supreme controller?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is an attempt to find the supreme controller, or isvara.</p>
<p>Everyone may be accepted as an isvara, or controller, but still such controllers are controlled by others.</p>
<p>For example, one may have undergone severe austerities but still be under the control of anger.</p>
<p>By a scrutinizing analysis, we find that everyone is controlled by something else.</p>
<p>No one, therefore, can be the true controller but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>This is supported by the sastras.</p>
<p>Isvarah paramah krsnah: (Bs.5.1) the supreme controller is Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna is never controlled by anyone, for He is the controller of everyone (sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>



<p><strong>8.8.21</strong></p>

<p>tyagah kvacit tatra na mukti-karanam</p>
<p>viryam na pumso ’sty aja-vega-niskrtam</p>
<p>na hi dvitiyo guna-sanga-varjitah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>dharmah—religion; kvacit—one may have full knowledge of; tatra—therein; na—not; bhuta-sauhrdam—friendship with other living entities; tyagah—renunciation; kvacit—one may possess; tatra—therein; na—not; mukti-karanam—the cause of liberation; viryam—power; na—not; pumsah—of any person; asti—there may be; aja-vega-niskrtam—no release from the power of time; na—nor; hi—indeed; dvitiyah—the second one; guna-sanga-varjitah—completely freed from the contamination of the modes of nature.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Someone may possess full knowledge of religion but still not be kind to all living entities.</p>
<p>In someone, whether human or demigod, there may be renunciation, but that is not the cause of liberation.</p>
<p>Someone may possess great power and yet be unable to check the power of eternal time.</p>
<p>Someone else may have renounced attachment to the material world, yet he cannot compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one is completely freed from the influence of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The statement dharmah kvacit tatra na bhuta-sauhrdam is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>We actually see that there are many Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and religionists of other cults who adhere to their religious principles very nicely but are not equal to all living entities.</p>
<p>Indeed, although they profess to be very religious, they kill poor animals.</p>
<p>Such religion has no meaning.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.8) says:</p>
<p>dharmah svanusthitah pumsam</p>
<p>visvaksena-kathasu yah</p>
<p>notpadayed yadi ratim</p>
<p>srama eva hi kevalam</p>
<p>One may be very expert in following the religious principles of his own sect, but if he has no tendency to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his observance of religious principles is simply a waste of time.</p>
<p>One must develop a sense of loving Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>The sign of a devotee is that he is a friend to everyone (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam).</p>
<p>A devotee will never allow a poor animal to be killed in the name of religion.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a superficially religious person and a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>We find that there have been many great heroes in history, but they could not escape from the cruel hands of death.</p>
<p>Even the greatest hero cannot escape from the ruling power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when Krsna comes as death.</p>
<p>That is described by Krsna Himself: mrtyuh sarva-haras caham.</p>
<p>The Lord, appearing as death, takes away a hero’s so-called power.</p>
<p>Even Hiranyakasipu could not be saved when Nrsimhadeva appeared before him as death.</p>
<p>One’s material strength is nothing before the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kvacit—someone; cira-ayuh—has a long duration of life; na—not; hi—indeed; sila-mangalam—good behavior or auspiciousness; kvacit—someone; tat api—although possessing good behavior; asti—is; na—not; vedyam ayusah—aware of the duration of life; yatra ubhayam—if there are both (behavior and auspiciousness); kutra—somewhere; ca—also; sah—that person; api—although; amangalah—a little inauspicious in some other detail; su-mangalah—auspicious in every respect; kasca—someone; na—not; kanksate—desires; hi—indeed; mam—me.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Someone may have longevity but not have auspiciousness or good behavior.</p>
<p>Someone may have both auspiciousness and good behavior, but the duration of his life is not fixed.</p>
<p>Although such demigods as Lord Siva have eternal life, they have inauspicious habits like living in crematoriums.</p>
<p>And even if others are well qualified in all respects, they are not devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: In this way, after full deliberation, the goddess of fortune accepted Mukunda as her husband because although He is independent and not in want of her, He possesses all transcendental qualities and mystic powers and is therefore the most desirable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, is self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Since He is fully independent, He was not in want of the support or association of Laksmidevi.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, accepted Him as her husband.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the goddess of fortune placed upon His shoulders the garland of newly grown lotus flowers, which was surrounded by humming bumblebees searching for honey.</p>
<p>Then, expecting to get a place on the bosom of the Lord, she remained standing by His side, her face smiling in shyness.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasyah—of her; sriyah—the goddess of fortune; tri-jagatah—of the three worlds; janakah—the father; jananyah—of the mother; vaksah—bosom; nivasam—residence; akarot—made; paramam—supreme; vibhuteh—of the opulent; srih—the goddess of fortune; svah—own; prajah—descendants; sa-karunena—with favorable mercy; niriksanena—by glancing over; yatra—wherein; sthita—staying; aidhayata—increased; sa-adhipatin—with the great directors and leaders; tri-lokan—the three worlds.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father of the three worlds, and His bosom is the residence of mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, the proprietor of all opulences.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, by her favorable and merciful glance, can increase the opulence of the three worlds, along with their inhabitants and their directors, the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the desire of Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, the Supreme Personality of Godhead made His bosom her residence so that by her glance she could favor everyone, including the demigods and ordinary human beings.</p>
<p>In other words, since the goddess of fortune stays on the bosom of Narayana, she naturally sees any devotee who worships Narayana.</p>
<p>When the goddess of fortune understands that a devotee is in favor of devotional service to Narayana, she is naturally inclined to bless the devotee with all opulences.</p>
<p>The karmis try to receive the favor and mercy of Laksmi, but because they are not devotees of Narayana, their opulence is flickering.</p>
<p>The opulence of devotees who are attached to the service of Narayana is not like the opulence of karmis.</p>
<p>The opulence of devotees is as permanent as the opulence of Narayana Himself.</p>

<p>They began dancing and singing along with their wives.</p>

<p>Thus they were very much satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mithah—among themselves; kalih—disagreement and quarrel; abhut—there was; tesam—of all of them; tat-arthe—for the sake of nectar; tarsa-cetasam—bewildered in heart and soul by the illusory energy of Visnu; aham—I; purvam—first; aham—I; purvam—first; na—not; tvam—you; na—not; tvam—you; iti—thus; prabho—O King.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, a quarrel then arose among the demons over who would get the nectar first.</p>
<p>Each of them said, You cannot drink it first.</p>
<p>I must drink it first.</p>
<p>Me first, not you</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the symptom of demons.</p>
<p>The first concern of a nondevotee is how to enjoy his personal sense gratification at once, whereas the devotee’s first concern is to satisfy the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the distinction between the nondevotee and the devotee.</p>
<p>In this material world, since most people are nondevotees, they regularly compete, fight, disagree and war among themselves, for everyone wants to enjoy and satisfy his own senses.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless such demons become Krsna conscious and are trained to satisfy the senses of the Lord, there can be no question of peace in human society or any society, even that of the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods and devotees, however, always surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus the Lord is always anxious to satisfy their ambitions.</p>
<p>While the demons fight to satisfy their own senses, devotees engage in devotional service to satisfy the senses of the Lord.</p>
<p>The members of the Krsna consciousness movement must be alert in regard to this point, and then their preaching of the Krsna consciousness movement will be successful.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Some of the demons said, All the demigods have taken part in churning the ocean of milk.</p>
<p>Now, as everyone has an equal right to partake in any public sacrifice, according to the eternal religious system it is befitting that the demigods now have a share of the nectar O King, in this way the weaker demons forbade the stronger demons to take the nectar.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Desiring to take the nectar, those among the demons who were less strong spoke in favor of the demigods.</p>
<p>The weaker Daityas naturally pleaded on behalf of the demigods to stop the stronger Daityas from drinking the nectar without sharing it.</p>
<p>In this way, disagreement and trouble arose as they forbade one another to drink the nectar.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who can counteract any unfavorable situation, then assumed the form of an extremely beautiful woman.</p>
<p>This incarnation as a woman, Mohini-murti, was most pleasing to the mind.</p>
<p>Her complexion resembled in color a newly grown blackish lotus, and every part of Her body was beautifully situated.</p>
<p>Her ears were equally decorated with earrings, Her cheeks were very beautiful, Her nose was raised and Her face full of youthful luster.</p>
<p>Her large breasts made Her waist seem very thin.</p>
<p>Attracted by the aroma of Her face and body, bumblebees hummed around Her, and thus Her eyes were restless.</p>
<p>Her hair, which was extremely beautiful, was garlanded with mallika flowers.</p>
<p>Her attractively constructed neck was decorated with a necklace and other ornaments, Her arms were decorated with bangles, Her body was covered with a clean sari, and Her breasts seemed like islands in an ocean of beauty.</p>
<p>Her legs were decorated with ankle bells.</p>
<p>Because of the movements of Her eyebrows as She smiled with shyness and glanced over the demons, all the demons were saturated with lusty desires, and every one of them desired to possess Her.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Because of the Supreme Lord’s assuming the form of a beautiful woman to arouse the lusty desires of the demons, a description of Her complete beauty is given here.</p>
