<h1>Lord Siva Saves the Universe by Drinking Poison</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.7</strong></p>
<p>The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows.</p>
<p>As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry Mandara Mountain on His back.</p>
<p>At first the churning of the ocean produced kalakuta poison.</p>
<p>Everyone feared this poison, but Lord Siva satisfied them by drinking it.</p>
<p>With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought Vasuki to be used as the rope for the churning rod.</p>
<p>By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake.</p>
<p>Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions.</p>
<p>Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back.</p>
<p>Then the churning resumed with great force.</p>
<p>As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced.</p>
<p>The prajapatis, seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord Siva and offered him prayers full of truth.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is called Asutosa because he is very pleased if one is a devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning.</p>
<p>The goddess Durga, Bhavani, the wife of Lord Siva, was not at all disturbed when Lord Siva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord Siva’s prowess.</p>
<p>Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement.</p>
<p>Then Lord Siva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere.</p>
<p>He took it in his hand and drank it.</p>
<p>After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish.</p>
<p>A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.</p>

<p><strong>8.7.3</strong></p>
<p>tan naicchan daitya-patayo</p>
<p>maha-purusa-cestitam</p>
<p>na grhnimo vayam puccham</p>
<p>aher angam amangalam</p>
<p>svadhyaya-sruta-sampannah</p>
<p>prakhyata janma-karmabhih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tat—that arrangement; na aicchan—not liking; daitya-patayah—the leaders of the demons; maha-purusa—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; cestitam—attempt; na—not; grhnimah—shall take; vayam—all of us (the Daityas); puccham—the tail; aheh—of the serpent; angam—part of the body; amangalam—inauspicious, inferior; svadhyaya—with Vedic study; sruta—and Vedic knowledge; sampannah—fully equipped; prakhyatah—prominent; janma-karmabhih—by birth and activities.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The leaders of the demons thought it unwise to hold the tail, the inauspicious portion of the snake.</p>
<p>Instead, they wanted to hold the front, which had been taken by the Personality of Godhead and the demigods, because that portion was auspicious and glorious.</p>
<p>Thus the demons, on the plea that they were all highly advanced students of Vedic knowledge and were all famous for their birth and activities, protested that they wanted to hold the front of the snake.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demons thought that the front of the snake was auspicious and that catching hold of that portion would be more chivalrous.</p>
<p>Moreover, Daityas must always do the opposite of the demigods.</p>
<p>That is their nature.</p>
<p>We have actually seen this in relation to our Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>We are advocating cow protection and encouraging people to drink more milk and eat palatable preparations made of milk, but the demons, just to protest such proposals, are claiming that they are advanced in scientific knowledge, as described here by the words svadhyaya-sruta-sampannah.</p>
<p>They say that according to their scientific way, they have discovered that milk is dangerous and that the beef obtained by killing cows is very nutritious.</p>
<p>This difference of opinion will always continue.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has existed since days of yore.</p>
<p>Millions of years ago, there was the same competition.</p>
<p>The demons, as a result of their so-called Vedic study, preferred to hold the side of the snake near the mouth.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead thought it wise to catch hold of the dangerous part of the snake and allow the demons to hold the tail, which was not dangerous, but because of a competitive desire, the demons thought it wise to hold the snake near the mouth.</p>
<p>If the demigods were going to drink poison, the demons would resolve, Why should we not share the poison and die gloriously by drinking it In regard to the words svadhyaya-sruta-sampannah prakhyata janma-karmabhih, another question may be raised.</p>
<p>If one is actually educated in Vedic knowledge, is famous for performing prescribed activities and has been born in a great aristocratic family, why should he be called a demon? The answer is that one may be highly educated and may have been born in an aristocratic family, but if he is godless, if he does not listen to the instructions of God, then he is a demon.</p>
<p>There are many examples in history of men like Hiranyakasipu, Ravana and Kamsa who were well educated, who were born in aristocratic families and who were very powerful and chivalrous in fighting, but who, because of deriding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were called Raksasas, or demons.</p>
<p>One may be very well educated, but if he has no sense of Krsna consciousness, no obedience to the Supreme Lord, he is a demon.</p>
<p>That is described by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):</p>
<p>na mam duskrtino mudhah</p>
<p>prapadyante naradhamah</p>
<p>mayayapahrta-jnana</p>
<p>asuram bhavam asritah</p>
<p>Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me Asuram bhavam refers to not accepting the existence of God or the transcendental instructions of the Personality of Godhead.Bhagavad-gita clearly consists of transcendental instructions imparted directly by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But asuras, instead of accepting these instructions directly, make commentaries according to their own whimsical ways and mislead everyone, without profit even for themselves.</p>
<p>One should therefore be very careful of demoniac, godless persons.</p>
<p>According to the words of Lord Krsna, even if a godless demon is very well educated, he must be considered a mudha, naradhama and mayayapahrta jnana.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is evidence that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller of everything.</p>
<p>As we have previously described, there are two classes of men—the demons and the demigods—but neither of them are supremely powerful.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the supreme power.</p>
<p>The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept them to be acts of the supreme ruler.</p>
<p>When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord.</p>
<p>Tat te ’nukampam susamiksamano bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam.</p>
<p>Devotees endure hindrances, accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions.</p>
<p>Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as accidental.</p>
<p>Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally.</p>
<p>It was by His will that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed.</p>
<p>The Lord appeared as a tortoise to support the great mountain.</p>
<p>Ksitir iha vipulatare tava tisthati prsthe.</p>
<p>The Lord held the great mountain on His back.</p>
<p>Kesava dhrta-kurma-sarira jaya jagadisa hare.</p>
<p>Dangers can be created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they can also be removed by Him.</p>
<p>This is known to devotees, but demons cannot understand it.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, when the demigods and demons, by the strength of their arms, rotated Mandara Mountain on the back of the extraordinary tortoise, the tortoise accepted the rolling of the mountain as a means of scratching His body, and thus He felt a pleasing sensation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always the unlimited.</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His body as a tortoise, held on His back the largest of mountains, Mandara-parvata, He did not feel any inconvenience.</p>
<p>On the contrary, He apparently felt some itching, and thus the rotation of the mountain was certainly very pleasing.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everyone in this material world is under the different modes of material nature.</p>
<p>There were three different parties in the churning of Mandara Mountain—the demigods, who were in the mode of goodness, the demons, who were in the mode of passion, and the snake Vasuki, who was in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>Since they were all becoming tired (Vasuki so much so that he was almost going to die), Lord Visnu, to encourage them to continue the work of churning the ocean, entered into them according to their respective modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>

<p>Nonetheless the churning of the ocean continued in this way.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The fish, sharks, tortoises and snakes were most agitated and perturbed.</p>
<p>The entire ocean became turbulent, and even the large aquatic animals like whales, water elephants, crocodiles and timingila fish (large whales that can swallow small whales) came to the surface.</p>
<p>While the ocean was being churned in this way, it first produced a fiercely dangerous poison called halahala.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, when that uncontrollable poison was forcefully spreading up and down in all directions, all the demigods, along with the Lord Himself, approached Lord Siva (Sadasiva).</p>
<p>Feeling unsheltered and very much afraid, they sought shelter of him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One may question that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present, why did He accompany all the demigods and people in general to take shelter of Lord Sadasiva, instead of intervening Himself.</p>
<p>In this connection Srila Madhvacarya warns:</p>
<p>rudrasya yasaso ’rthaya</p>
<p>svayam visnur visam vibhuh</p>
<p>na sanjahre samartho ’pi</p>
<p>vayum coce prasantaye</p>
<p>Lord Visnu was competent to rectify the situation, but in order to give credit to Lord Siva, who later drank all the poison and kept it in his neck, Lord Visnu did not take action.</p>

<p>The demigods observed Lord Siva sitting on the summit of Kailasa Hill with his wife, Bhavani, for the auspicious development of the three worlds.</p>
<p>He was being worshiped by great saintly persons desiring liberation.</p>
<p>The demigods offered him their obeisances and prayers with great respect.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-prajapatayah ucuh—the prajapatis said; deva-deva—O Lord Mahadeva, best of the demigods; maha-deva—O great demigod; bhuta-atman—O life and soul of everyone in this world; bhuta-bhavana—O the cause of the happiness and flourishing of all of them; trahi—deliver; nah—us; sarana-apannan—who have taken shelter at your lotus feet; trailokya—of the three worlds; dahanat—which is causing the burning; visat—from this poison.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The prajapatis said: O greatest of all demigods, Mahadeva, Supersoul of all living entities and cause of their happiness and prosperity, we have come to the shelter of your lotus feet.</p>
<p>Now please save us from this fiery poison, which is spreading all over the three worlds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Lord Siva is in charge of annihilation, why should he be approached for protection, which is given by Lord Visnu? Lord Brahma creates, and Lord Siva annihilates, but both Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are incarnations of Lord Visnu and are known as saktyavesa-avataras.</p>
<p>They are endowed with a special power like that of Lord Visnu, who is actually all-pervading in their activities.</p>
<p>Therefore whenever prayers for protection are offered to Lord Siva, actually Lord Visnu is indicated, for otherwise Lord Siva is meant for destruction.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is one of the isvaras, or the controllers known as saktyavesa-avataras.</p>
<p>Therefore he can be addressed as having the qualities of Lord Visnu.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tvam ekah—Your Lordship is indeed; sarva-jagatah—of the three worlds; isvarah—the controller; bandha-moksayoh—of both bondage and liberation; tam—that controller; tvam arcanti—worship you; kusalah—persons who want good fortune; prapanna-arti-haram—who can mitigate all the distresses of a sheltered devotee; gurum—you who act as a good advisor to all fallen souls.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lord, you are the cause of bondage and liberation of the entire universe because you are its ruler.</p>
<p>Those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness surrender unto you, and therefore you are the cause of mitigating their distresses, and you are also the cause of their liberation.</p>
<p>We therefore worship Your Lordship.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Actually Lord Visnu maintains and accomplishes all good fortune.</p>
<p>If one has to take shelter of Lord Visnu, why should the demigods take shelter of Lord Siva? They did so because Lord Visnu acts through Lord Siva in the creation of the material world.</p>
<p>Lord Siva acts on behalf of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>When the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (14.4) that He is the father of all living entities (aham bija-pradah pita), this refers to actions performed by Lord Visnu through Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is always unattached to material activities, and when material activities are to be performed, Lord Visnu performs them through Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is therefore worshiped on the level of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>When Lord Visnu is untouched by the external energy He is Lord Visnu, but when He is in touch with the external energy, He appears in His feature as Lord Siva.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lord, you are self-effulgent and supreme.</p>
<p>You create this material world by your personal energy, and you assume the names Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara when you act in creation, maintenance and annihilation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This prayer is actually offered to Lord Visnu, the purusa, who in His incarnations as the guna-avataras assumes the names Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You are the cause of all causes, the self-effulgent, inconceivable, impersonal Brahman, which is originally Parabrahman.</p>
<p>You manifest various potencies in this cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This prayer is offered to the impersonal Brahman, which consists of the effulgent rays of Parabrahman.</p>
<p>Parabrahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>When Lord Siva is worshiped as Parabrahman, the worship is meant for Lord Visnu.</p>

<p>You are eternal time, determination and the two religious systems called truth (satya) and truthfulness (rta).</p>
<p>You are the shelter of the syllable om, which consists of three letters a-u-m.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O father of all planes, learned scholars know that fire is your mouth, the surface of the globe is your lotus feet, eternal time is your movement, all the directions are your ears, and Varuna, master of the waters, is your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the sruti-mantras it is said, agnih sarva-devatah: Fire is the aggregate of all demigods Agni is the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is through Agni, or fire, that the Lord accepts all sacrificial oblations.</p>

<p>You are the shelter of all kinds of living entities, high and low.</p>
<p>The god of the moon is your mind, and the upper planeary system is your head.</p>

<p>The seven seas are your abdomen, and the mountains are your bones.</p>
<p>All drugs, creepers and vegetables are the hairs on your body, the Vedic mantras like Gayatri are the seven layers of your body, and the Vedic religious system is the core of your heart.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>mukhani—faces; panca—five; upanisadah—Vedic literatures; tava—your; isa—O lord; yaih—by which; trimsat-asta-uttara-mantra-vargah—in the category of thirty-eight important Vedic mantras; yat—that; tat—as it is; siva-akhyam—celebrated by the name Siva; paramatma-tattvam—which ascertain the truth about Paramatma; deva—O lord; svayam-jyotih—self-illuminated; avasthitih—situation; te—of Your Lordship.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lord, the five important Vedic mantras are represented by your five faces, from which the thirty-eight most celebrated Vedic mantras have been generated.</p>
<p>Your Lordship, being celebrated as Lord Siva, is self-illuminated.</p>
<p>You are directly situated as the supreme truth, known as Paramatma.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sadyojata, (4) Vamadeva, and (5) Isana.</p>
<p>These five mantras are within the category of thirty-eight special Vedic mantras chanted by Lord Siva, who is therefore celebrated as Siva or Mahadeva.</p>
<p>Another reason why Lord Siva is called Siva, which means all-auspicious is that he is self-illuminated, exactly like Lord Visnu, who is the Paramatma.</p>
<p>Because Lord Siva is directly an incarnation of Lord Visnu, he is situated as Lord Visnu’s direct representative.</p>
<p>This fact is corroborated by a Vedic mantra: patim visvasyatmesvaram sasvatam sivam acyutam.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is called by many names, of which Mahesvara, Siva and Acyuta are especially mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lord, your shadow is seen in irreligion, which brings about varieties of irreligious creations.</p>
<p>The three modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—are your three eyes.</p>
<p>All the Vedic literatures, which are full of verses, are emanations from you because their compilers wrote the various scriptures after receiving your glance.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Lord Girisa, since the impersonal Brahman effulgence is transcendental to the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, the various directors of this material world certainly cannot appreciate it or even know where it is.</p>
<p>It is not understandable even to Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu or the King of heaven, Mahendra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The brahmajyoti is actually the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.40):</p>
<p>yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-</p>
<p>kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam</p>
<p>tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power.</p>
<p>The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planes, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes Although the impersonal feature of the Absolute is an expansion of the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He does not need to take care of the impersonalists who enter the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), maya tatam idam sarvam jagad avyakta-murtina: In My impersonal feature I pervade this entire universe Thus the avyakta-murti, the impersonal feature, is certainly an expansion of Krsna’s energy.</p>
<p>Mayavadis, who prefer to merge into this Brahman effulgence, worship Lord Siva.</p>
<p>The mantras referred to in text 29 are called mukhani pancopanisadas tavesa.</p>
<p>Mayavadis take all these mantras seriously in worshiping Lord Siva sarva-sarvebhyo mrtyave, (11) namas te ’stu ksudha .., (12) rudra-rupebhyas trsna .., (13) vamadevaya raja .., (14) jyesthaya svaha rudraya kalyanyai, (17) kalaya kama manah-sosinyai, (25) unmanaya jvara.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kama-adhvara—sacrifices for sense gratification (like Daksa-yajna, the sacrifices performed by Daksa); tripura—the demon named Tripurasura; kalagara—Kalagara; adi—and others; aneka—many; bhuta-druhah—who are meant for giving trouble to the living entities; ksapayatah—being engaged in their destruction; stutaye—your prayer; na—not; tat—that; te—speaking to you; yah tu—because; anta-kale—at the time of annihilation; idam—in this material world; atma-krtam—done by yourself; sva-netra—by your eyes; vahni-sphulinga-sikhaya—by the sparks of fire; bhasitam—burned to ashes; na veda—I do not know how it is happening.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When annihilation is performed by the flames and sparks emanating from your eyes, the entire creation is burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you do not know how this happens.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of your destroying the Daksa-yajna, Tripurasura and the kalakuta poison? Such activities cannot be subject matters for prayers offered to you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Lord Siva considers the great acts he performs to be very unimportant, what was to be said of counteracting the strong poison produced by the churning? The demigods indirectly prayed that Lord Siva counteract the kalakuta poison, which was spreading throughout the universe.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ye—persons who; tu—indeed; atma-rama-gurubhih—by those who are self-satisfied and who are considered to be spiritual masters of the world; hrdi—within the heart; cintita-anghri-dvandvam—thinking of your two lotus feet; carantam—moving; umaya—with your consort, Uma; tapasa abhitaptam—highly advanced through practice of austerity and penance; katthante—criticize your acts; ugra-parusam—not a gentle person; niratam—always; smasane—in the crematorium; te—such persons; nunam—indeed; utim—such activities; avidan—not knowing; tava—your activities; hata-lajjah—shameless.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Exalted, self-satisfied persons who preach to the entire world think of your lotus feet constantly within their hearts.</p>
<p>However, when persons who do not know your austerity see you moving with Uma, they misunderstand you to be lusty, or when they see you wandering in the crematorium they mistakenly think that you are ferocious and envious.</p>
<p>Certainly they are shameless.</p>
<p>They cannot understand your activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Siva is the topmost Vaisnava (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh).</p>
<p>It is therefore said, vaisnavera kriya-mudra vijne na bujhaya.</p>
<p>Even the most intelligent person cannot understand what a Vaisnava like Lord Siva is doing or how he is acting.</p>
<p>Those who are conquered by lusty desires and anger cannot estimate the glories of Lord Siva, whose position is always transcendental.</p>
<p>In all the activities associated with lusty desires, Lord Siva is an implement of atma-rama.</p>
<p>Ordinary persons, therefore, should not try to understand Lord Siva and his activities.</p>
<p>One who tries to criticize the activities of Lord Siva is shameless.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Even personalities like Lord Brahma and other demigods cannot understand your position, for you are beyond the moving and nonmoving creation.</p>
<p>Since no one can understand you in truth, how can one offer you prayers? It is impossible.</p>
<p>As far as we are concerned, we are creatures of Lord Brahma’s creation.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, therefore, we cannot offer you adequate prayers, but as far as our ability allows, we have expressed our feelings.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O greatest of all rulers, your actual identity is impossible for us to understand.</p>
<p>As far as we can see, your presence brings flourishing happiness to everyone.</p>
<p>Beyond this, no one can appreciate your activities.</p>
<p>We can see this much, and nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When the demigods offered these prayers to Lord Siva, their inner purpose was to please him so that he would rectify the disturbing situation created by the halahala poison.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: when one worships demigods, this is certainly because of deep-rooted desires he wants fulfilled by the mercy of those demigods.</p>
<p>People are generally attached to the worship of demigods for some motive.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>8.7.39</strong></p>
<p>pranaih svaih praninah panti</p>
<p>sadhavah ksana-bhanguraih</p>
<p>baddha-vairesu bhutesu</p>
<p>mohitesv atma-mayaya</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>People in general, being bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are always engaged in animosity toward one another.</p>
<p>But devotees, even at the risk of their own temporary lives, try to save them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the characteristic of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Para-duhkha-duhkhi: a Vaisnava is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls unhappy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he would have no business teaching them how to become happy.</p>
<p>In materialistic life, people must certainly engage in activities of animosity.</p>
<p>Materialistic life is therefore compared to samsara-davanala, a blazing forest fire that automatically takes place.</p>
<p>Lord Siva and his followers in the parampara system try to save people from this dangerous condition of materialistic life.</p>
<p>This is the duty of devotees following the principles of Lord Siva and belonging to the Rudra-sampradaya.</p>
<p>There are four Vaisnava sampradayas, and the Rudra-sampradaya is one of them because Lord Siva (Rudra) is the best of the Vaisnavas (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh).</p>
<p>Indeed, as we shall see, Lord Siva drank all the poison for the benefit of humanity.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although there was such a great quantity of poison that it spread all over the universe, Lord Siva had such great power that he reduced the poison to a small quantity so that he could hold it in his palm.</p>
<p>One should not try to imitate Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Siva can do whatever he likes, but those who try to imitate Lord Siva by smoking ganja and other poisonous things will certainly be killed because of such activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As if in defamation, the poison born from the ocean of milk manifested its potency by marking Lord Siva’s neck with a bluish line.</p>
<p>That line, however, is now accepted as an ornament of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general.</p>
<p>This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.68–69), ya idam paramam guhyam mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah: One who preaches the message of Bhagavad-gita to My devotees is most dear to Me.</p>
<p>No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of karma cannot be checked.</p>
<p>It is by destiny, or the laws of karma, that one must suffer or enjoy.</p>
<p>For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit.</p>
<p>Similarly, everyone is under obligations to karma and it reactions.</p>
<p>No one can change this.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastra says:</p>
<p>tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido</p>
<p>na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah</p>
<p>(Bhag.1.5.18)</p>
<p>One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of karma.</p>
<p>What is that? One should endeavor to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>If one tries to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity.</p>
<p>The Lord is automatically very pleased with him.</p>
<p>If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (tesam nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham (Bg.9.22)).</p>
<p>Again, as stated here, tapyante loka-tapena sadhavah prayaso janah.</p>
<p>The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of Krsna consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>
<p>tadatmanam srjamy aham</p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam</p>
<p>vinasaya ca duskrtam</p>
<p>dharma-samsthapanarthaya</p>
<p>sambhavami yuge yuge</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself.</p>
<p>To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium (Bg.4.7–8) All the sastras conclude, therefore, that spreading the Krsna consciousness movement is the best welfare activity in the world.</p>
<p>Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee.</p>



<p><strong>8.7.45</strong></p>

<p>Upon hearing of this act, everyone, including Bhavani (the daughter of Maharaja Daksa), Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu, and the people in general, very highly praised this deed performed by Lord Siva, who is worshiped by the demigods and who bestows benedictions upon the people.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Scorpions, cobras, poisonous drugs and other animals whose bites are poisonous took the opportunity to drink whatever little poison had fallen and scattered from Lord Siva’s hand while he was drinking.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Mosquitoes, jackals, dogs and other varieties of dandasuka, or animals whose bites are poisonous, drank the poison of the samudra-manthana, the churned ocean, since it was available after it fell from the palms of Lord Siva.</p>
