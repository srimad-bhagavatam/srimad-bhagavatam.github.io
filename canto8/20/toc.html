<h1><a class="header" href="#bali-maharaja-surrenders-the-universe" id="bali-maharaja-surrenders-the-universe">Bali Maharaja Surrenders the Universe</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#820" id="820">8.20</a></strong></p>
<p>The summary of this Twentieth Chapter is as follows.</p>
<p>Despite his knowledge that Lord Vamanadeva was cheating him, Bali Maharaja gave everything to the Lord in charity, and thus the Lord extended His body and assumed a gigantic form as Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>After hearing the instructive advice of Sukracarya, Bali Maharaja became contemplative.</p>
<p>Because it is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification, Bali Maharaja thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the brahmacari.</p>
<p>To lie or fail to honor a promise given to a brahmacari is never proper, for lying is the most sinful activity.</p>
<p>Everyone should be afraid of the sinful reactions to lying, for mother earth cannot even bear the weight of a sinful liar.</p>
<p>The spreading of a kingdom or empire is temporary; if there is no benefit for the general public, such expansion has no value.</p>
<p>Previously, all the great kings and emperors expanded their kingdoms with a regard for the welfare of the people in general.</p>
<p>Indeed, while engaged in such activities for the benefit of the general public, eminent men sometimes even sacrificed their lives.</p>
<p>It is said that one who is glorious in his activities is always living and never dies.</p>
<p>Therefore, fame should be the aim of life, and even if one becomes poverty-stricken for the sake of a good reputation, that is not a loss.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja thought that even if this brahmacari, Vamanadeva, were Lord Visnu, if the Lord accepted his charity and then again arrested him, Bali Maharaja would not envy Him.</p>
<p>Considering all these points, Bali Maharaja finally gave in charity everything he possessed.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva then immediately extended Himself into a universal body.</p>
<p>By the mercy of Lord Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaja could see that the Lord is all-pervading and that everything rests in His body.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja could see Lord Vamanadeva as the supreme Visnu, wearing a helmet, yellow garments, the mark of Srivatsa, the Kaustubha jewel, a flower garland, and ornaments decorating His entire body.</p>
<p>The Lord gradually covered the entire surface of the world, and by extending His body He covered the entire sky.</p>
<p>With His hands He covered all directions, and with His second footstep He covered the entire upper planetary system.</p>
<p>Therefore there was no vacant place where He could take His third footstep.</p>

<p>sri-suka uvaca</p>
<p>balir evam grha-patih</p>
<p>kulacaryena bhasitah</p>
<p>tusnim bhutva ksanam rajann</p>
<p>uvacavahito gurum</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; balih—Bali Maharaja; evam—thus; grha-patih—the master of the household affairs, although guided by the priests; kula-acaryena—by the family acarya or guide; bhasitah—being thus addressed; tusnim—silent; bhutva—becoming; ksanam—for a moment; rajan—O King (Maharaja Pariksit); uvaca—said; avahitah—after full deliberation; gurum—unto his spiritual master.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King Pariksit, when Bali Maharaja was thus advised by his spiritual master, Sukracarya, his family priest, he remained silent for some time, and then, after full deliberation, he replied to his spiritual master as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Bali Maharaja remained silent at a critical point.</p>
<p>How could he disobey the instruction of Sukracarya, his spiritual master? It is the duty of such a sober personality as Bali Maharaja to abide by the orders of his spiritual master immediately, as his spiritual master had advised.</p>
<p>But Bali Maharaja also considered that Sukracarya was no longer to be accepted as a spiritual master, for he had deviated from the duty of a spiritual master.</p>
<p>According to sastra, the duty of the guru is to take the disciple back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a guru.</p>
<p>Gurur na sa syat (Bhag.5.5.18).</p>
<p>One should not become a guru if he cannot enable his disciple to advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The goal of life is to become a devotee of Lord Krsna so that one may be freed from the bondage of material existence (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>The spiritual master helps the disciple attain this stage by developing Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Now Sukracarya has advised Bali Maharaja to deny the promise to Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, therefore, Bali Maharaja thought that there would be no fault if he disobeyed the order of his spiritual master.</p>
<p>He deliberated on this point—should he refuse to accept the advise of his spiritual master, or should he independently do everything to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He took some time.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, tusnim bhutva ksanam rajann uvacavahito gurum.</p>
<p>After deliberating on this point, he decided that Lord Visnu should be pleased in all circumstances, even at the risk of ignoring the guru’s advice to the contrary.</p>
<p>Anyone who is supposed to be a guru but who goes against the principle of visnu-bhakti cannot be accepted as guru.</p>
<p>If one has falsely accepted such a guru, one should reject him.</p>
<p>Such a guru is described as follows (Mahabharata, Udyoga179.25):</p>
<p>guror apy avaliptasya</p>
<p>karyakaryam ajanatah</p>
<p>utpatha-pratipannasya</p>
<p>parityago vidhiyate</p>
<p>Srila Jiva Gosvami has advised that such a useless guru, a family priest acting as guru, should be given up, and that the proper, bona-fide guru should be accepted sat-karma-nipuno vipro</p>
<p>mantra-tantra-visaradah</p>
<p>avaisnavo gurur na syad</p>
<p>vaisnavah svapaco guruh</p>
<p>A scholarly brahmana expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vaisnava, but if a person born in a family of a lower caste is a Vaisnava, he can become a spiritual master (Padma Purana)</p>
