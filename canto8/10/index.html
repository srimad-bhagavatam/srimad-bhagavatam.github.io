<h1>The Battle Between the Demigods and the Demons</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.10</strong></p>
<p>The summary of Chapter Ten is as follows.</p>
<p>Because of envy, the fight between the demons and the demigods continued.</p>
<p>When the demigods were almost defeated by demoniac maneuvers and became morose, Lord Visnu appeared among them.</p>
<p>Both the demigods and the demons are expert in activities involving the material energy, but the demigods are devotees of the Lord, whereas the demons are just the opposite.</p>
<p>The demigods and demons churned the ocean of milk to get nectar from it, but the demons, not being devotees of the Lord, could derive no profit.</p>
<p>After feeding nectar to the demigods, Lord Visnu returned to His abode on the back of Garuda, but the demons, being most aggrieved, again declared war against the demigods.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, the son of Virocana, became the commander in chief of the demons.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the battle, the demigods prepared to defeat the demons.</p>
<p>Indra, King of heaven, fought with Bali, and other demigods, like Vayu, Agni and Varuna, fought against other leaders of the demons.</p>
<p>In this fight the demons were defeated, and to save themselves from death they began to manifest many illusions through material maneuvers, killing many soldiers on the side of the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods, finding no other recourse, surrendered again to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who then appeared and counteracted all the illusions presented by the jugglery of the demons.</p>
<p>Heroes among the demons such as Kalanemi, Mali, Sumali and Malyavan fought the Supreme Personality of Godhead and were all killed by the Lord.</p>
<p>The demigods were thus freed from all dangers.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of the impact on the ground of the legs of the demons and demigods and the wheels of the chariots, particles of dust flew violently into the sky and made a dust cloud that covered all directions of outer space, as far as the sun.</p>
<p>But when the particles of dust were followed by drops of blood being sprinkled all over space, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The cloud of dust covered the entire horizon, but when drops of blood sprayed up as far as the sun, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky.</p>
<p>A point to be observed here is that although the blood is stated to have reached the sun, it is not said to have reached the moon.</p>
<p>Apparently, therefore, as stated elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam, the sun, not the moon, is the plane nearest the earth.</p>
<p>We have already discussed this point in many places.</p>
<p>The sun is first, then the moon, then Mars, Jupiter and so on.</p>
<p>The sun is supposed to be 93,000,000 miles above the surface of the earth, and from the Srimad-Bhagavatam we understand that the moon is 1,600,000 miles above the sun.</p>
<p>Therefore the distance between the earth and the moon would be about 95,000,000 miles.</p>
<p>So if a space capsule were traveling at the speed of 18,000 miles per hour, how could it reach the moon in four days? At that speed, going to the moon would take at least seven months.</p>
<p>That a space capsule on a moon excursion has reached the moon in four days is therefore impossible.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
