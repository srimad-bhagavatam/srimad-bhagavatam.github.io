<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#810" id="810">8.10</a></strong></p>
<p>The summary of Chapter Ten is as follows.</p>
<p>Because of envy, the fight between the demons and the demigods continued.</p>
<p>When the demigods were almost defeated by demoniac maneuvers and became morose, Lord Visnu appeared among them.</p>
<p>Both the demigods and the demons are expert in activities involving the material energy, but the demigods are devotees of the Lord, whereas the demons are just the opposite.</p>
<p>The demigods and demons churned the ocean of milk to get nectar from it, but the demons, not being devotees of the Lord, could derive no profit.</p>
<p>After feeding nectar to the demigods, Lord Visnu returned to His abode on the back of Garuda, but the demons, being most aggrieved, again declared war against the demigods.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, the son of Virocana, became the commander in chief of the demons.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the battle, the demigods prepared to defeat the demons.</p>
<p>Indra, King of heaven, fought with Bali, and other demigods, like Vayu, Agni and Varuna, fought against other leaders of the demons.</p>
<p>In this fight the demons were defeated, and to save themselves from death they began to manifest many illusions through material maneuvers, killing many soldiers on the side of the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods, finding no other recourse, surrendered again to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who then appeared and counteracted all the illusions presented by the jugglery of the demons.</p>
<p>Heroes among the demons such as Kalanemi, Mali, Sumali and Malyavan fought the Supreme Personality of Godhead and were all killed by the Lord.</p>
<p>The demigods were thus freed from all dangers.</p>
