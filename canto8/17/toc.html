<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p><strong><a class="header" href="#817" id="817">8.17</a></strong></p>
<p>As explained in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being very pleased by the payo-vrata ceremony performed by Aditi, appeared before her in full opulence.</p>
<p>At her request, the Lord agreed to become her son.</p>
<p>After Aditi performed the payo-vrata ceremony for twelve continuous days, the Lord, who was certainly very pleased with her, appeared before her with four hands and dressed in yellow garments.</p>
<p>As soon as Aditi saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present before her, she immediately got up, and with great ecstatic love for the Lord she fell to the ground to offer respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>Aditi’s throat was choked because of ecstatic feelings, and her entire body trembled with devotion.</p>
<p>Although she wanted to offer suitable prayers to the Lord, she could not do anything, and thus she remained silent for some time.</p>
<p>Then, feeling solace, observing the beauty of the Lord, she offered her prayers.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of all living entities, was very pleased with her, and He agreed to become her son by incarnating as a plenary expansion.</p>
<p>He was already pleased by Kasyapa Muni’s austerities, and thus He agreed to become their son and maintain the demigods.</p>
<p>After giving His word of honor to this effect, the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p>Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi engaged in the service of Kasyapa Muni, who could see by samadhi that the Lord was within him and who thus placed his semen in the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma, who is known as Hiranyagarbha, understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had entered Aditi’s womb.</p>
<p>Thus he offered prayers to the Lord.</p>
