<h1>The Supreme Lord Agrees to Become Aditi’s Son</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.17</strong></p>
<p>As explained in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being very pleased by the payo-vrata ceremony performed by Aditi, appeared before her in full opulence.</p>
<p>At her request, the Lord agreed to become her son.</p>
<p>After Aditi performed the payo-vrata ceremony for twelve continuous days, the Lord, who was certainly very pleased with her, appeared before her with four hands and dressed in yellow garments.</p>
<p>As soon as Aditi saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present before her, she immediately got up, and with great ecstatic love for the Lord she fell to the ground to offer respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>Aditi’s throat was choked because of ecstatic feelings, and her entire body trembled with devotion.</p>
<p>Although she wanted to offer suitable prayers to the Lord, she could not do anything, and thus she remained silent for some time.</p>
<p>Then, feeling solace, observing the beauty of the Lord, she offered her prayers.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of all living entities, was very pleased with her, and He agreed to become her son by incarnating as a plenary expansion.</p>
<p>He was already pleased by Kasyapa Muni’s austerities, and thus He agreed to become their son and maintain the demigods.</p>
<p>After giving His word of honor to this effect, the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p>Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi engaged in the service of Kasyapa Muni, who could see by samadhi that the Lord was within him and who thus placed his semen in the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma, who is known as Hiranyagarbha, understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had entered Aditi’s womb.</p>
<p>Thus he offered prayers to the Lord.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of those who observe vows and austerities, and it is He who bestows benedictions upon them.</p>
<p>He is worshipable for the devotee throughout the devotee’s life, for He never breaks His promises.</p>
<p>As He says in Bhagavad-gita (9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes The Lord is addressed here as acyuta, the infallible, because He takes care of His devotees.</p>
<p>Anyone inimical to the devotees is certainly vanquished by the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is the source of the Ganges water, and therefore He is addressed here as tirtha-pada, indicating that all the holy places are at His lotus feet, or that whatever He touches with His foot becomes a holy place.Bhagavad-gita, for example, begins with the words dharma-ksetre kuru-ksetre (Bg.1.1).</p>
<p>Because the Lord was present on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, it became a dharma-ksetra, a place of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Therefore the Pandavas, who were extremely religious, were assured of victory.</p>
<p>Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead displays His pastimes, such as Vrndavana or Dvaraka, becomes a holy place.</p>
<p>The chanting of the holy name of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—is pleasing to the ear, and it expands good fortune to the audience who hears it chanted.</p>
<p>Owing to the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi was fully assured that the troublesome condition created for her by the demons would now be ended.</p>

<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi2.117) it is said:</p>
<p>siddhanta baliya citte na kara alasa</p>
<p>iha ha-ite krsne lage sudrdha manasa</p>
<p>Anyone trying to become fully Krsna conscious must know the Lord’s glories as far as they are possible to understand.</p>
<p>Here Aditi hints at these glories.</p>
<p>The universe is nothing but the external potency of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4): maya tatam idam sarvam.</p>
<p>Whatever we see in this universe is but an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the sunshine and heat all over the universe are expansions of the sun.</p>

<p>tapasa cira-sambhrtam</p>
<p>samahita-mana rajan</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—Kasyapa; adityam—unto Aditi; viryam—semen; adhatta—placed; tapasa—by austerity; cira-sambhrtam—restrained for long, long years; samahita-manah—being fully in trance upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rajan—O King; daruni—as in firewood; agnim—fire; yatha—as; anilah—wind.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, as the wind promotes friction between two pieces of wood and thus gives rise to fire, Kasyapa Muni, whose transcendental position was fully absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, transferred his potency into the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A forest fire begins when two pieces of wood rub against one another, being agitated by the wind.</p>
<p>Actually, however, fire belongs neither to the wood nor to the wind; it is always different from both.</p>
<p>Similarly, here it is to be understood that the union of Kasyapa Muni and Aditi was not like the sexual intercourse of ordinary human beings.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do with the human secretions of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>He is always completely aloof from such material combinations.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu: I am equal toward all living entities Nonetheless, to protect the devotees and kill the demons, who were a disturbing element, the Lord entered the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>Therefore this is a transcendental pastime of the Lord.</p>
<p>This should not be misunderstood.</p>
<p>One should not think that the Lord became the son of Aditi the way an ordinary child is born because of sexual intercourse between man and woman.</p>
<p>Here it may also be appropriate to explain, in these days of controversy, the origin of life.</p>
<p>The life force of the living entity—the soul—is different from the ovum and semen of the human being.</p>
<p>Although the conditioned soul has nothing to do with the reproductive cells of man and woman, he is placed into the proper situation because of his work (karmana daiva-netrena).</p>
<p>Life is not, however, a product of two secretions, but is independent of all material elements.</p>
<p>As fully described in Bhagavad-gita, the living entity is not subject to any material reactions.</p>
<p>He can neither be burnt by fire, cut by sharp weapons, moistened by water, nor dried by the air.</p>
<p>He is completely different from the physical elements, but by a superior arrangement he is put into these material elements.</p>
<p>He is always aloof from material contact (asango hy ayam purusah) but because he is placed in a material condition, he suffers the reactions of the material modes of nature purusah prakrti-stho hi</p>
<p>bhunkte prakrtijan gunan</p>
<p>karanam guna-sango ’sya</p>
<p>sad-asad-yoni-janmasu</p>
<p>The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>This is due to his association with that material nature.</p>
<p>Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species (Bg.13.22) Although the living entity is aloof from the material elements, he is put into material conditions, and thus he must suffer the reactions of material activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Brahma understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was now within the womb of Aditi, he began to offer prayers to the Lord by reciting transcendental names.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead exists everywhere (andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham).</p>
<p>Therefore when one chants His transcendental names—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—the Supreme Personality of Godhead is automatically pleased by such sankirtana.</p>
<p>It is not that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is absent; He is present there.</p>
<p>And when a devotee utters the transcendental name, it is not a material sound.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally pleased.</p>
<p>A devotee knows that the Lord is present everywhere and that one can please Him simply by chanting His holy name.</p>
