<h1>Bali Mahārāja Conquers the Heavenly Planets</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>8.15</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes how Bali, after performing the Visvajit-yajna, received the benediction of a chariot and various kinds of paraphernalia for war, with which he attacked the King of heaven.</p>
<p>All the demigods, being afraid of him, left the heavenly planes and went away, following the instructions of their guru.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit wanted to understand how Lord Vamanadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of land from Bali Maharaja, took everything away from him and arrested him.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami responded to this inquiry with the following explanation.</p>
<p>In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, Bali was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the grace of Sukracarya he regained his life.</p>
<p>Thus he engaged himself in the service of Sukracarya, his spiritual master.</p>
<p>The descendants of Bhrgu, being pleased with him, engaged him in the Visvajit-yajna.</p>
<p>When this yajna was performed, from the fire of yajna came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of arrows.</p>
<p>Maharaja Prahlada, Bali Maharaja’s grandfather, gave Bali an eternal garland of flowers, and Sukracarya gave him a conchshell.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, after offering obeisances to Prahlada, the brahmanas and his spiritual master, Sukracarya, equipped himself to fight with Indra and went to Indrapuri with his soldiers.</p>
<p>Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra’s kingdom.</p>
<p>When Indra saw Bali Maharaja’s prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, Brhaspati, told him about Bali’s strength, and inquired about his duty.</p>
<p>Brhaspati informed the demigods that because Bali had been endowed with extraordinary power by the brahmanas, the demigods could not fight with him.</p>
<p>Their only hope was to gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was no alternative.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Brhaspati advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planes and keep themselves somewhere invisible.</p>
<p>The demigods followed his orders, and Bali Maharaja, along with his associates, gained the entire kingdom of Indra.</p>
<p>The descendants of Bhrgu Muni, being very affectionate to their disciple Bali Maharaja, engaged him in performing one hundred asvamedha-yajnas.</p>
<p>In this way, Bali enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planes.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, said: O Indra, I know the cause for your enemy’s becoming so powerful.</p>
<p>The brahmana descendants of Bhrgu Muni, being pleased by Bali Maharaja, their disciple, endowed him with such extraordinary power.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, informed Indra, Ordinarily, Bali and his forces could not achieve such strength, but it appears that the brahmana descendants of Bhrgu Muni, being pleased with Bali Maharaja, endowed them with this spiritual power In other words, Brhaspati informed Indra that Bali Maharaja’s prowess was not his own but that of his exalted guru, Sukracarya.</p>
<p>We sing in our daily prayers, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ’pi .</p>
<p>By the pleasure of the spiritual master, one can get extraordinary power, especially in spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>The blessings of the spiritual master are more powerful than one’s personal endeavor for such advancement.</p>
<p>Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says:</p>
<p>ara na kariha mane asa</p>
<p>Especially for spiritual advancement, one should carry out the bona fide order of the spiritual master.</p>
<p>By the parampara system, one can thus be endowed with the original spiritual power coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh (Bg.4.2)).</p>

<p>Bali Maharaja has now become extremely powerful because of the benedictions given him by the brahmanas, but when he later insults the brahmanas, he will be vanquished, along with his friends and assistants.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja and Indra were enemies.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, predicted that Bali Maharaja would be vanquished when he insulted the brahmanas by whose grace he had become so powerful, Bali Maharaja’s enemies were naturally anxious to know when that opportune moment would come.</p>
<p>To pacify King Indra, Brhaspati assured him that the time would certainly come, for Brhaspati could see that in the future Bali Maharaja would defy the orders of Sukracarya in order to pacify Lord Visnu, Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Of course, to advance in Krsna consciousness, one can take all risks.</p>
<p>To please Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaja risked defying the orders of his spiritual master, Sukracarya.</p>
<p>Because of this, he would lose all his property, yet because of devotional service to the Lord, he would get more than he expected, and in the future, in the eighth manvantara, he would occupy the throne of Indra again.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We have seen in the dispute between Maharaja Prthu and Indra that when Maharaja Prthu wanted to perform one hundred asvamedha-yajnas, Indra wanted to impede him, for it is because of such great sacrifices that Indra was made King of heaven.</p>
<p>Here the brahmana descendants of Bhrgu decided that although Maharaja Bali was situated on the throne of Indra, he would not be able to stay there unless he performed such sacrifices.</p>
<p>Therefore they advised Maharaja Bali to perform at least as many asvamedha-yajnas as Indra.</p>
<p>The word ayajayan indicates that all the brahmanas induced Bali Maharaja to perform such sacrifices.</p>

<p>The brahmanas are called dvija-deva, and ksatriyas are generally called nara-deva.</p>
<p>The word deva actually refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The brahmanas guide human society in becoming happy by satisfying Lord Visnu, and according to their advice, the ksatriyas, who are called nara-deva, keep law and order so that other people, namely the vaisyas and sudras, may properly follow regulative principles.</p>
<p>In this way, people are gradually elevated to Krsna consciousness.</p>
