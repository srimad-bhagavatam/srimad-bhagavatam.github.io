<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vyasadeva was further inquisitive to know about the perfection of Naradaji, and therefore he wanted to know about him more and more.</p>
<p>In this chapter Naradaji will describe how he was able to have a brief audience with the Lord while he was absorbed in the transcendental thought of separation from the Lord and when it was very painful for him.</p>
