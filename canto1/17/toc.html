<p>sutah uvaca—Sri Suta Gosvami said; tatra—thereupon; go-mithunam—a cow and a bull; raja—the King; hanyamanam—being beaten; anatha-vat—appearing to be bereft of their owner; danda-hastam—with a club in hand; ca—also; vrsalam—lower-caste sudra; dadrse—observed; nrpa—a king; lanchanam—dressed like.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Suta Gosvami said:</p>
<p>After reaching that place, Maharaja Pariksit observed that a lower-caste sudra, dressed like a king, was beating a cow and a bull with a club, as if they had no owner.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower-caste sudras, i.e., men without brahminical culture and spiritual initiation, will be dressed like administrators or kings, and the principal business of such non-ksatriya rulers will be to kill the innocent animals, especially the cows and the bulls, who shall be unprotected by their masters, the bona fide vaisyas, the mercantile community.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavad-gita (18.44), it is said that the vaisyas are meant to deal in agriculture, cow protection and trade.</p>
<p>In the age of Kali, the degraded vaisyas, the mercantile men, are engaged in supplying cows to slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>The ksatriyas are meant to protect the citizens of the state, whereas the vaisyas are meant to protect the cows and bulls and utilize them to produce grains and milk.</p>
<p>The cow is meant to deliver milk, and the bull is meant to produce grains.</p>
<p>But in the age of Kali, the sudra class of men are in the posts of administrators, and the cows and bulls, or the mothers and the fathers, unprotected by the vaisyas, are subjected to the slaughterhouses organized by the sudra administrators.</p>
