<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, Sri Krsna, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p>I meditate upon Lord Sri Krsna because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes.</p>
<p>He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him.</p>
<p>It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmaji, the original living being.</p>
<p>By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water.</p>
<p>Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal.</p>
<p>I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Sri Krsna, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world.</p>
<p>I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, directly indicate Lord Sri Krsna, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaki.</p>
<p>This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work.</p>
<p>Sri Vyasadeva asserts herein that Sri Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion.</p>
<p>Srila Jiva Gosvami has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his Krsna-sandarbha.</p>
<p>And Brahma, the original living being, has explained the subject of Sri Krsna substantially in his treatise named Brahma-samhita.</p>
<p>In the Sama-veda Upanisad, it is also stated that Lord Sri Krsna is the divine son of Devaki.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord Sri Krsna is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word Krsna, which means the all-attractive.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like Narada, Vyasa, and many others.</p>
<p>In the Padma Purana, it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of Krsna is the principal one.</p>
<p>Vasudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with Vasudeva, are indicated in this text.</p>
<p>The name Vasudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaki.</p>
<p>Sri Krsna is always meditated upon by the paramahamsas, who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Vasudeva, or Lord Sri Krsna, is the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Everything that exists emanates from the Lord.</p>
<p>How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work.</p>
<p>This work is described by Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanya as the spotless Purana because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>The history of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is also very glorious.</p>
<p>It was compiled by Sri Vyasadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>He wrote this under the instructions of Sri Naradaji, his spiritual master.</p>
<p>Vyasadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the Vedas, the Vedanta-sutras (or the Brahma-sutras), the Puranas, the Mahabharata, and so on.</p>
<p>But nevertheless he was not satisfied.</p>
<p>His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus Narada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work.</p>
<p>But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.</p>
<p>It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation.</p>
<p>At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants.</p>
<p>Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals.</p>
<p>The author of Srimad-Bhagavatam gives a direct answer to such inquiries.</p>
<p>He says that the Lord Sri Krsna is the origin of all creations.</p>
<p>He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well.</p>
<p>The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord.</p>
<p>It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will.</p>
<p>Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities.</p>
<p>Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities.</p>
<p>All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahma, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings.</p>
<p>And above Brahma, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being.</p>
<p>And He is an individual as are the other living beings.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties.</p>
<p>If a man’s brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior.</p>
<p>The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree.</p>
<p>Srila Vyasadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the paramesvara.</p>
<p>He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the para or the paramesvara or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>And that paramesvara is Sri Krsna, as admitted in Bhagavad-gita and other scriptures delivered by Sri Vyasadeva and specifically in this Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that there is no other para-tattva (summum bonum) than Himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sri Vyasadeva at once worships the para-tattva, Sri Krsna, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord’s rasa dance.</p>
<p>This portion of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is the most confidential part of this great literature.</p>
<p>Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord’s worshipable transcendental pastimes called rasa dance and His love affairs with the gopis.</p>
<p>This subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of paramahamsa can transcendentally relish this rasa dance.</p>
<p>Srila Vyasadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, he purposely invokes a Gayatri mantra, dhimahi.</p>
<p>This Gayatri mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people.</p>
<p>When one is successful in chanting the Gayatri mantra, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord.</p>
<p>One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the Gayatri mantra successfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His fame, His qualities and so on.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is the narration of the svarupa of the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience.</p>
<p>Srila Vyasadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this sloka.</p>
<p>Sri Vyasadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert.</p>
<p>In the desert mirage there is no actual water.</p>
<p>There is only the appearance of water.</p>
<p>Real water is somewhere else.</p>
<p>The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality.</p>
<p>But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky.</p>
<p>In the material sky everything is relative truth.</p>
<p>That is to say, one truth depends on something else.</p>
<p>This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahma, Indra, Candra, and so on.</p>
<p>In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world.</p>
<p>There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia.</p>
<p>The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction.</p>
<p>He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by demigods.</p>
<p>Beginning from Brahma down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the material creation.</p>
<p>The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere.</p>
<p>All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only.</p>
<p>And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent.</p>
<p>He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on.</p>
<p>The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different.</p>
<p>Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Conditioned souls, beginning from Brahma, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them are independent of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self.</p>
<p>This is called maya, or illusion.</p>
<p>Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence.</p>
<p>This is refuted in this sloka by Srila Vyasadeva:</p>
<p>Since the complete whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied.</p>
<p>Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.</p>
<p>In the sruti-mantra, it is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman is the ultimate source of everything.</p>
<p>Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him.</p>
<p>And at the end, everything enters into Him.</p>
<p>That is the law of nature.</p>
<p>In the smrti-mantra, the same is confirmed.</p>
<p>It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahma’s millennium and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth or Brahman.</p>
<p>Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun.</p>
<p>Herein, the ultimate source is explained.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic literatures, Brahma, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator.</p>
<p>It is stated in this sloka that Brahma was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One may argue that Brahma, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time.</p>
<p>Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahma, in order that Brahma could carry out his creative functions.</p>
<p>So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, Lord Sri Krsna states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy, prakrti, which constitutes the totality of matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sri Vyasadeva does not worship Brahma, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahma in his creative activities.</p>
<p>In this sloka, the particular words abhijnah and svarat are significant.</p>
<p>These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities.</p>
<p>No other living entity is either abhijnah or svarat.</p>
<p>That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent.</p>
<p>Even Brahma has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create.</p>
<p>Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being.</p>
<p>Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even Mayavadi impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither abhijnah or svarat.</p>
<p>Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord.</p>
<p>But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples.</p>
<p>Atheists like Ravana or Hiranyakasipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord.</p>
<p>But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death.</p>
<p>This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord.</p>
<p>Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself.</p>
<p>Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita in the well-known verse yada yada hi dharmasya glanih Whenever there is a decline of dharma and a rise of adharma, O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself (Bg.4.7) That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all sruti-mantras.</p>
<p>It is said in the sruti-mantras that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings.</p>
<p>The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations.</p>
<p>An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms.</p>
<p>The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God’s further attention.</p>
<p>If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God.</p>
<p>But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one can create as well as God.</p>
<p>Another name for God is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him.</p>
<p>Param satyam, or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the sruti-mantras.</p>
<p>It is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone.</p>
<p>That Lord instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Unless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that he will be bewildered.</p>
<p>When an intelligent man surrenders unto the lotus feet of Krsna and knows completely that Krsna is the cause of all causes, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, then only can such an intelligent man become a mahatma, or great soul.</p>
<p>But such a great soul is rarely seen.</p>
<p>Only the mahatmas can understand that the Supreme Lord is the primeval cause of all creations.</p>
<p>He is parama or ultimate truth because all other truths are relative to Him.</p>
<p>He is omniscient.</p>
<p>For Him, there is no illusion.</p>
<p>Some Mayavadi scholars argue that Srimad-Bhagavatam was not compiled by Sri Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>And some of them suggest that this book is a modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva.</p>
<p>In order to refute such meaningless arguments, Sri Sridhara Svami points out that there is reference to the Bhagavatam in many of the oldest Puranas.</p>
<p>This first sloka of the Bhagavatam begins with the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p>There is reference to this in the Matsya Purana, which is the oldest Purana.</p>
<p>In that Purana, it is said with reference to the Gayatri mantra in the Bhagavatam that there are many narrations of spiritual instructions beginning with the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p>And there is the history of Vrtrasura.</p>
<p>Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead.</p>
<p>There is reference to the Bhagavatam in other Puranas also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand slokas.</p>
<p>In the Padma Purana also there is reference to the Bhagavatam in a conversation between Gautama and Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>The king was advised therein to read regularly Srimad-Bhagavatam if he desired liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Within the past five hundred years, many erudite scholars and acaryas like Jiva Gosvami, Sanatana Gosvami, Visvanatha Cakravarti, Vallabhacarya, and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya made elaborate commentaries on the Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>And the serious student would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcendental messages.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura specifically deals with the original and pure sex psychology (adi-rasa), devoid of all mundane inebriety.</p>
<p>The whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life.</p>
<p>In modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities.</p>
<p>Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant.</p>
<p>Therefore, sex life is not unreal.</p>
<p>Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact.</p>
<p>The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal.</p>
<p>It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life.</p>
<p>Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all.</p>
<p>There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life.</p>
<p>This Srimad-Bhagavatam will gradually elevate the unbiased reader to the highest perfectional stage of transcendence.</p>
<p>It will enable him to transcend the three modes of material activities: fruitive actions, speculative philosophy, and worship of functional deities as inculcated in Vedic verses.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bhagavata Purana propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart.</p>
<p>The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all.</p>
<p>Such truth uproots the threefold miseries.</p>
<p>This beautiful Bhagavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyasadeva (in his maturity), is sufficient in itself for God realization.</p>
<p>What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bhagavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Religion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, economic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>Irreligious life is a barbarous condition.</p>
<p>Indeed, human life begins when religion begins.</p>
<p>Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are the four principles of animal life.</p>
<p>These are common both to animals and to human beings.</p>
<p>But religion is the extra function of the human being.</p>
<p>Without religion, human life is no better than animal life.</p>
<p>Therefore, in human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization and which makes reference to man’s eternal relationship with God.</p>
<p>In the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition to lord it over the material nature or, in other words, there is a continuous rivalry to satisfy the senses.</p>
<p>Driven by such consciousness, man turns to religion.</p>
<p>He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order to gain something material.</p>
<p>But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected.</p>
<p>This is the situation in modern civilization.</p>
<p>Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion.</p>
<p>Churches, mosques or temples are now practically vacant.</p>
<p>Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers.</p>
<p>This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains.</p>
<p>Economic gains are needed for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently, all these states are simply different types of sense gratification.</p>
<p>In the Vedas, the above-mentioned four activities are prescribed in the regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense gratification.</p>
<p>But Srimad-Bhagavatam is transcendental to all these sense gratificatory activities.</p>
<p>It is purely transcendental literature which can be understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord who are transcendental to competitive sense gratification.</p>
<p>In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation.</p>
<p>But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions.</p>
<p>They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful.</p>
<p>Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart.</p>
<p>In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition.</p>
<p>But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center.</p>
<p>The contemporary socialist’s conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the Vedas or from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life.</p>
<p>There are three paths mentioned in the Vedas.</p>
<p>One involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets.</p>
<p>Another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him.</p>
<p>The impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest.</p>
<p>Above the impersonal feature is the Paramatma feature, and above this is the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, or Bhagavan.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam gives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature.</p>
<p>It is higher than impersonalist literatures and higher than the jnana-kanda division of the Vedas.</p>
<p>It is even higher than the karma-kanda division, and even higher than the upasana-kanda division, because it recommends the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>In the karma-kanda, there is competition to reach heavenly planets for better sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the jnana-kanda and the upasana-kanda.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam is superior to all of these because it aims at the Supreme Truth which is the substance or the root of all categories.</p>
<p>From Srimad-Bhagavatam one can come to know the substance as well as the categories.</p>
<p>The substance is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy.</p>
<p>Nothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies are different from the substance.</p>
<p>This conception is not contradictory.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam explicitly promulgates this simultaneously-one-and-different philosophy of the Vedanta-sutra, which begins with the janmady asy (Bhag.1.1.1) sutra.</p>
<p>This knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators’ attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute.</p>
<p>When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect.</p>
<p>Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously-one-and-different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries.</p>
<p>The threefold miseries are (1) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (2) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (3) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person.</p>
<p>The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute.</p>
<p>In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life.</p>
<p>But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries.</p>
<p>As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one’s spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances.</p>
<p>Over and above this, Srimad-Bhagavatam is a personal commentation on the Vedanta-sutra by Sri Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of Narada.</p>
<p>Sri Vyasadeva is the authorized incarnation of Narayana, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no question as to his authority.</p>
<p>He is the author of all other Vedic literatures, yet he recommends the study of Srimad-Bhagavatam above all others.</p>
<p>In other Puranas there are different methods set forth by which one can worship the demigods.</p>
<p>But in the Bhagavatam only the Supreme Lord is mentioned.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body.</p>
<p>Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended the Srimad-Bhagavatam as the spotless Purana and distinguishes it from all other Puranas.</p>
<p>The proper method for receiving this transcendental message is to hear it submissively.</p>
<p>A challenging attitude cannot help one realize this transcendental message.</p>
<p>One particular word is used herein for proper guidance.</p>
<p>This word is susrusu.</p>
<p>One must be anxious to hear this transcendental message.</p>
<p>The desire to sincerely hear is the first qualification.</p>
<p>Less fortunate persons are not at all interested in hearing this Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The process is simple, but the application is difficult.</p>
<p>Unfortunate people find enough time to hear idle social and political conversations, but when invited to attend a meeting of devotees to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam they suddenly become reluctant.</p>
<p>Sometimes professional readers of the Bhagavatam immediately plunge into the confidential topics of the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, which they seemingly interpret as sex literature.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is meant to be heard from the beginning.</p>
<p>Those who are fit to assimilate this work are mentioned in this sloka:</p>
<p>One becomes qualified to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam after many pious deeds The intelligent person, with thoughtful discretion, can be assured by the great sage Vyasadeva that he can realize the Supreme Personality directly by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Without undergoing the different stages of realization set forth in the Vedas, one can be lifted immediately to the position of paramahamsa simply by agreeing to receive this message.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O expert and thoughtful men, relish Srimad-Bhagavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>It emanated from the lips of Sri Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the two previous slokas it has been definitely proved that the Srimad-Bhagavatam is the sublime literature which surpasses all other Vedic scriptures due to its transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>It is transcendental to all mundane activities and mundane knowledge.</p>
<p>In this sloka it is stated that Srimad-Bhagavatam is not only a superior literature but is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>In other words, it is the cream of all Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>Considering all this, patient and submissive hearing is definitely essential.</p>
<p>With great respect and attention, one should receive the message and lessons imparted by the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The Vedas are compared to the desire tree because they contain all things knowable by man.</p>
<p>They deal with mundane necessities as well as spiritual realization.</p>
<p>The Vedas contain regulated principles of knowledge covering social, political, religious, economic, military, medicinal, chemical, physical and metaphysical subject matter and all that may be necessary to keep the body and soul together.</p>
<p>Above and beyond all this are specific directions for spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Regulated knowledge involves a gradual raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual realization is knowledge that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all spiritual tastes, or rasas.</p>
<p>Every living entity, beginning from Brahma, the first-born living being within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions.</p>
<p>These sensual pleasures are technically called rasas.</p>
<p>Such rasas are of different varieties.</p>
<p>In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of rasas are enumerated: (1) raudra (anger), (2) adbhuta (wonder), (3) srngara (conjugal love), (4) hasya (comedy), (5) vira (chivalry), (6) daya (mercy), (7) dasya (servitorship), (8) sakhya (fraternity), (9) bhayanaka (horror), (10) bibhatsa (shock), (11) santa (neutrality), (12) vatsalya (parenthood).</p>
<p>The sum total of all these rasas is called affection or love.</p>
<p>Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, paternal affection, and conjugal love.</p>
<p>And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on.</p>
<p>For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the rasa is called conjugal love.</p>
<p>But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror.</p>
<p>Sometimes love affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes.</p>
<p>Such rasas are displayed between man and man and between animal and animal.</p>
<p>There is no possibility of an exchange or rasa between a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living beings within the material world.</p>
<p>The rasas are exchanged between members of the same species.</p>
<p>But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, the rasas were originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The spiritual exchange or rasa is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the sruti-mantras, Vedic hymns, as the fountainhead of all rasas When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one’s constitutional rasa with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.</p>
<p>These sruti-mantras indicate that every living being has its constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of rasa to be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the liberated condition only, this primary rasa is experienced in full.</p>
<p>In the material existence, the rasa is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary.</p>
<p>And thus the rasas of the material world are exhibited in the material form of raudra (anger) and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different rasas, which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original rasas which are reflected in the material world.</p>
<p>The learned scholar seeks to relish the real rasa in the spiritual form.</p>
<p>In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme.</p>
<p>Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different rasas.</p>
<p>In this sloka, it is definitely stated that spiritual rasa, which is relished even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the Srimad-Bhagavatam due to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can attain the full pleasure of his heart’s desire.</p>
<p>But one must be very careful to hear the message from the right source.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is exactly received from the right source.</p>
<p>It was brought by Narada Muni from the spiritual world and given to his disciple Sri Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>The latter in turn delivered the message to his son Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, and Srila Sukadeva Gosvami delivered the message to Maharaja Pariksit just seven days before the King’s death.</p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami was a liberated soul from his very birth.</p>
<p>He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth.</p>
<p>At birth no one is qualified, neither in the mundane nor in the spiritual sense.</p>
<p>But Sri Sukadeva Gosvami, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Yet despite his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcendental rasa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is adored by liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord’s pastimes are more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people.</p>
<p>He is of necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcendental rasa with a person.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons, including those who seek liberation and those who seek to become one with the supreme whole.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as suka.</p>
<p>When a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced.</p>
<p>The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the Bhagavatam exactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men.</p>
<p>The subject matter is so presented through the lips of Srila Sukadeva Gosvami that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world.</p>
<p>The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of Krsnaloka.</p>
<p>Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance.</p>
<p>Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental rasa known as the rasa dance without following in the footsteps of Sukadeva Gosvami, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization.</p>
<p>One should be intelligent enough to know the position of Srimad-Bhagavatam by considering personalities like Sukadeva Gosvami, who deals with the subject so carefully.</p>
<p>This process of disciplic succession of the Bhagavata school suggests that in the future also Srimad-Bhagavatam has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of Srila Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the Bhagavatam illegally is certainly not a representative of Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>Such a man’s business is only to earn his livelihood.</p>
<p>Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men.</p>
<p>Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject.</p>
<p>They usually plunge into the subject matter of the rasa dance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men.</p>
<p>Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations.</p>
<p>They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of Srila Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the rasa should receive the message of Bhagavatam in the chain of disciplic succession from Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, who describes the Bhagavatam from its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of Sukadeva Gosvami or his bona fide representative.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Once, in a holy place in the forest of Naimisaranya, great sages headed by the sage Saunaka assembled to perform a great thousand-year sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The prelude of the Srimad-Bhagavatam was spoken in the previous three slokas.</p>
<p>Now the main topic of this great literature is being presented.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam, after its first recitation by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, was repeated for the second time at Naimisaranya.</p>
<p>In the Vayaviya Tantra, it is said that Brahma, the engineer of this particular universe, contemplated a great wheel which could enclose the universe.</p>
<p>The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known as Naimisaranya.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimisaranya in the Varaha Purana, where it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed.</p>
<p>Thus brahmanas prefer Naimisaranya for such sacrificial performances.</p>
<p>The devotees of Lord Visnu offer all kinds of sacrifices for His pleasure.</p>
<p>The devotees are always attached to the service of the Lord, whereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, it is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the pleasure of Lord Visnu causes further bondage for the performer.</p>
<p>It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Visnu and His devotees.</p>
<p>This will bring everyone peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>The great sages are always anxious to do good to the people in general, and as such the sages headed by Saunaka and others assembled at this holy place of Naimisaranya with a program of performing a great and continuous chain of sacrificial ceremonies.</p>
<p>Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world.</p>
<p>They are sincere friends to all living entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men, Siddhas, Caranas, Vidyadharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree.</p>
<p>By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished.</p>
<p>Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied.</p>
<p>Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts.</p>
<p>Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources.</p>
<p>The modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>And all its plans which are being made by atheistic leaders are sure to be baffled at every step.</p>
<p>Yet they do not wake up to this.</p>
<p>In this age, the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the prescribed method for waking up.</p>
<p>The ways and means are most scientifically presented by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and intelligent persons may take advantage of His teachings in order to bring about real peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is also presented for the same purpose, and this will be explained more specifically later in the text.</p>

<p>te—the sages; ekada—one day; tu—but; munayah—sages; pratah—morning; huta—burning; huta-agnayah—the sacrificial fire; sat-krtam—due respects; sutam—Sri Suta Gosvami; asinam—seated on; papracchuh—made inquiries; idam—on this (as follows); adarat—with due regards.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One day, after finishing their morning duties by burning a sacrificial fire and offering a seat of esteem to Srila Suta Gosvami, the great sages made inquiries, with great respect, about the following matters.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Morning is the best time to hold spiritual services.</p>
<p>The great sages offered the speaker of the Bhagavatam an elevated seat of respect called the vyasasana, or the seat of Sri Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>Sri Vyasadeva is the original spiritual preceptor for all men.</p>
<p>And all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives.</p>
<p>A representative is one who can exactly present the viewpoint of Sri Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>Sri Vyasadeva impregnated the message of Bhagavatam unto Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, and Sri Suta Gosvami heard it from him (Sri Sukadeva Gosvami).</p>
<p>All bona fide representatives of Sri Vyasadeva in the chain of disciplic succession are to be understood to be gosvamis.</p>
<p>These gosvamis restrain all their senses, and they stick to the path made by the previous acaryas.</p>
<p>The gosvamis do not deliver lectures on the Bhagavatam capriciously.</p>
<p>Rather, they execute their services most carefully, following their predecessors who delivered the spiritual message unbroken to them.</p>
<p>Those who listen to the Bhagavatam may put questions to the speaker in order to elicit the clear meaning, but this should not be done in a challenging spirit.</p>
<p>One must submit questions with a great regard for the speaker and the subject matter.</p>
<p>This is also the way recommended in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One must learn the transcendental subject by submissive aural reception from the right sources.</p>
<p>Therefore these sages addressed the speaker Suta Gosvami with great respect.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sages said:</p>
<p>Respected Suta Gosvami, you are completely free from all vice.</p>
<p>You are well versed in all the scriptures famous for religious life, and in the Puranas and the histories as well, for you have gone through them under proper guidance and have also explained them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A gosvami, or the bona fide representative of Sri Vyasadeva, must be free from all kinds of vices.</p>
<p>The four major vices of Kali-yuga are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) animal slaughter, (3) intoxication, (4) speculative gambling of all sorts.</p>
<p>A gosvami must be free from all these vices before he can dare sit on the vyasasana.</p>
<p>No one should be allowed to sit on the vyasasana who is not spotless in character and who is not freed from the above-mentioned vices.</p>
<p>He not only should be freed from all such vices, but must also be well versed in all revealed scriptures or in the Vedas.</p>
<p>The Puranas are also parts of the Vedas.</p>
<p>And histories like the Mahabharata or Ramayana are also parts of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The acarya or the gosvami must be well acquainted with all these literatures.</p>
<p>To hear and explain them is more important than reading them.</p>
<p>One can assimilate the knowledge of the revealed scriptures only by hearing and explaining.</p>
<p>Hearing is called sravana, and explaining is called kirtana.</p>
<p>The two processes of sravana and kirtana are of primary importance to progressive spiritual life.</p>
<p>Only one who has properly grasped the transcendental knowledge from the right source by submissive hearing can properly explain the subject.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Being the eldest learned Vedantist, O Suta Gosvami, you are acquainted with the knowledge of Vyasadeva, who is the incarnation of Godhead, and you also know other sages who are fully versed in all kinds of physical and metaphysical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is a natural commentation on the Brahma-sutra, or the Badarayani Vedanta-sutras.</p>
<p>It is called natural because Vyasadeva is author of both the Vedanta-sutras and Srimad-Bhagavatam, or the essence of all Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>Besides Vyasadeva, there are other sages who are the authors of six different philosophical systems, namely Gautama, Kanada, Kapila, Patanjali, Jaimini and Astavakra.</p>
<p>Theism is explained completely in the Vedanta-sutra, whereas in other systems of philosophical speculations, practically no mention is given to the ultimate cause of all causes.</p>
<p>One can sit on the vyasasana only after being conversant in all systems of philosophy so that one can present fully the theistic views of the Bhagavatam in defiance of all other systems.</p>
<p>Srila Suta Gosvami was the proper teacher, and therefore the sages at Naimisaranya elevated him to the vyasasana.</p>
<p>Srila Vyasadeva is designated herein as the Personality of Godhead because he is the authorized empowered incarnation.</p>

<p>Therefore you can tell us all that you have scientifically learned from them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The secret of success in spiritual life is in satisfying the spiritual master and thereby getting his sincere blessings.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has sung in his famous eight stanzas on the spiritual master as follows:</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master.</p>
<p>Only by his satisfaction can one please the Personality of Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on the path of spiritual realization It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much obedient and submissive to the bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Srila Suta Gosvami fulfilled all these qualifications as a disciple, and therefore he was endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters such as Srila Vyasadeva and others.</p>
<p>The sages of Naimisaranya were confident that Srila Suta Gosvami was bona fide.</p>
<p>Therefore they were anxious to hear from him.</p>

<p>Please, therefore, being blessed with many years, explain to us, in an easily understandable way, what you have ascertained to be the absolute and ultimate good for the people in general.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, worship of the acarya is recommended.</p>
<p>The acaryas and gosvamis are always absorbed in thought of the well-being of the general public, especially their spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>Spiritual wellbeing is automatically followed by material well-being.</p>
<p>The acaryas therefore give directions in spiritual well-being for people in general.</p>
<p>Foreseeing the incompetencies of the people in this age of Kali, or the iron age of quarrel, the sages requested that Suta Gosvami give a summary of all revealed scriptures because the people of this age are condemned in every respect.</p>
<p>The sages, therefore, inquired of the absolute good, which is the ultimate good for the people.</p>
<p>The condemned state of affairs of the people of this age is described as follows.</p>

<p>O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives.</p>
<p>They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The devotees of the Lord are always anxious for the spiritual improvement of the general public.</p>
<p>When the sages of Naimisaranya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this age of Kali, they foresaw that men would live short lives.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits.</p>
<p>By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any man can maintain his health.</p>
<p>Overeating, over-sense gratification, overdependence on another’s mercy, and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy.</p>
<p>Therefore the duration of life is shortened.</p>
<p>The people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the matter of self-realization.</p>
<p>The human life is especially meant for self-realization.</p>
<p>That is to say, man should come to know what he is, what the world is, and what the supreme truth is.</p>
<p>Human life is a means by which the living entity can end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to Godhead, his eternal home.</p>
<p>But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire for self-realization.</p>
<p>Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers.</p>
<p>In this age, men are victims not only of different political creeds and parties, but also of many different types of sense-gratificatory diversions, such as cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad association, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings, and so on.</p>
<p>Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements.</p>
<p>In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions.</p>
<p>Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body.</p>
<p>The student (brahmacari) communities are no longer being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the grhastha-asrama.</p>
<p>Consequently, the so-called vanaprasthas and sannyasis who come out of such grhastha-asramas are easily deviated from the rigid path.</p>
<p>In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness.</p>
<p>Men are no longer interested in spiritual values.</p>
<p>Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization.</p>
<p>For the maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups.</p>
<p>It has become very difficult, therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society.</p>
<p>The sages of Naimisaranya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from Srila Suta Gosvami.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There are many varieties of scriptures, and in all of them there are many prescribed duties, which can be learned only after many years of study in their various divisions.</p>
<p>Therefore, O sage, please select the essence of all these scriptures and explain it for the good of all living beings, that by such instruction their hearts may be fully satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Atma, or self, is distinguished from matter and material elements.</p>
<p>It is spiritual in constitution, and thus it is never satisfied by any amount of material planning.</p>
<p>All scriptures and spiritual instructions are meant for the satisfaction of this self, or atma.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of approaches which are recommended for different types of living beings in different times and at different places.</p>
<p>Consequently, the numbers of revealed scriptures are innumerable.</p>
<p>There are different methods and prescribed duties recommended in these various scriptures.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the fallen condition of the people in general in this age of Kali, the sages of Naimisaranya suggested that Sri Suta Gosvami relate the essence of all such scriptures because in this age it is not possible for the fallen souls to understand and undergo all the lessons of all these various scriptures in a varna and asrama system.</p>
<p>The varna and asrama society was considered to be the best institution for lifting the human being to the spiritual platform, but due to Kali-yuga it is not possible to execute the rules and regulations of these institutions.</p>
<p>Nor is it possible for the people in general to completely sever relations with their families as the varnasrama institution prescribes.</p>
<p>The whole atmosphere is surcharged with opposition.</p>
<p>And considering this, one can see that spiritual emancipation for the common man in this age is very difficult.</p>
<p>The reason the sages presented this matter to Sri Suta Gosvami is explained in the following verses.</p>

<p>Please explain to us those teachings imparted by previous masters (acaryas), for one is uplifted both by speaking them and by hearing them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The conditions for hearing the transcendental message of the Absolute Truth are set forth herein.</p>
<p>The first condition is that the audience must be very sincere and eager to hear.</p>
<p>And the speaker must be in the line of disciplic succession from the recognized acarya.</p>
<p>The transcendental message of the Absolute is not understandable by those who are materially absorbed.</p>
<p>Under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, one becomes gradually purified.</p>
<p>Therefore, one must be in the chain of disciplic succession and learn the spiritual art of submissive hearing.</p>
<p>In the case of Suta Gosvami and the sages of Naimisaranya, all these conditions are fulfilled because Srila Suta Gosvami is in the line of Srila Vyasadeva, and the sages of Naimisaranya are all sincere souls who are anxious to learn the truth.</p>
<p>Thus the transcendental topics of Lord Sri Krsna’s superhuman activities, His incarnation, His birth, appearance or disappearance, His forms, His names and so on are all easily understandable because all requirements are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Pure devotees of the Lord are more powerful than the waters of the sacred river Ganges.</p>
<p>One can derive spiritual benefit out of prolonged use of the Ganges waters.</p>
<p>But one can be sanctified at once by the mercy of a pure devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita it is said that any person, regardless of birth as sudra, woman, or merchant, can take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and by so doing can return to Godhead.</p>
<p>To take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to take shelter of the pure devotees.</p>
<p>The pure devotees whose only business is serving are honored by the names Prabhupada and Visnupada, which indicate such devotees to be representatives of the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Anyone, therefore, who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual master can be at once purified.</p>
<p>Such devotees of the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in the most confidential service of the Lord, for they deliver out of the material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Such pure devotees are better known as vicelords according to revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers the spiritual master equal to the Lord, but always considers himself to be a humble servant of the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the pure devotional path.</p>

<p>Who is there, desiring deliverance from the vices of the age of quarrel, who is not willing to hear the virtuous glories of the Lord?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The age of Kali is the most condemned age due to its quarrelsome features.</p>
<p>Kali-yuga is so saturated with vicious habits that there is a great fight at the slightest misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Those who are engaged in the pure devotional service of the Lord, who are without any desire for self-aggrandizement and who are freed from the effects of fruitive actions and dry philosophical speculations are capable of getting out of the estrangements of this complicated age.</p>
<p>The leaders of the people are very much anxious to live in peace and friendship, but they have no information of the simple method of hearing the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>On the contrary, such leaders are opposed to the propagation of the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>In other words, the foolish leaders want to completely deny the existence of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the name of secular state, such leaders are enacting various plans every year.</p>
<p>But by the insurmountable intricacies of the material nature of the Lord, all these plans for progress are being constantly frustrated.</p>
<p>They have no eyes to see that their attempts at peace and friendship are failing.</p>
<p>But here is the hint to get over the hurdle.</p>
<p>If we want actual peace, we must open the road to understanding of the Supreme Lord Krsna and glorify Him for His virtuous activities as they are depicted in the pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>

<p>tasya—His; karmani—transcendental acts; udarani—magnanimous; parigitani—broadcast; suribhih—by the great souls; bruhi—please speak; nah—unto us; sraddadhananam—ready to receive with respect; lilaya—pastimes; dadhatah—advented; kalah—incarnations.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>His transcendental acts are magnificent and gracious, and great learned sages like Narada sing of them.</p>
<p>Please, therefore, speak to us, who are eager to hear about the adventures He performs in His various incarnations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead is never inactive as some less intelligent persons suggest.</p>
<p>His works are magnificent and magnanimous.</p>
<p>His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness.</p>
<p>They are described nicely by such liberated souls as Srila Narada, Vyasa, Valmiki, Devala, Asita, Madhva, Sri Caitanya, Ramanuja, Visnusvami, Nimbarka, Sridhara, Visvanatha, Baladeva, Bhaktivinoda, Siddhanta Sarasvati and many other learned and self-realized souls.</p>
<p>These creations, both material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty and knowledge, but the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledge, bliss and eternity.</p>
<p>The material creations are manifested for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas.</p>
<p>They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things.</p>
<p>Such foolish men have no information of the reality, and they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all.</p>
<p>But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vyasa and Narada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightful, larger, and eternally full of bliss and knowledge.</p>
<p>Those who are not conversant with the activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm.</p>
<p>By such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world.</p>
<p>Some of these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>These less intelligent persons are known as karmis, or fruitive workers, and jnanis, or dry mental speculators.</p>
<p>But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as satvata, or the devotee, who is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation.</p>
<p>He is engaged in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the karmis and jnanis.</p>
<p>As the supreme controller of both the material and spiritual worlds, the Lord has different incarnations of unlimited categories.</p>
<p>Incarnations like Brahma, Rudra, Manu, Prthu and Vyasa are His material qualitative incarnations, but His incarnations like Rama, Narasimha, Varaha and Vamana are His transcendental incarnations.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna is the fountainhead of all incarnations, and He is therefore the cause of all causes.</p>

<p>For the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material worlds, the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead Himself appears in many thousands of forms of incarnations, and the specific adventures found in those transcendental forms are all auspicious.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>We never tire of hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, who is glorified by hymns and prayers.</p>
<p>Those who have developed a taste for transcendental relationships with Him relish hearing of His pastimes at every moment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is a great difference between mundane stories, fiction, or history and the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p>The histories of the whole universe contain references to the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas are histories of bygone ages recorded in connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord and therefore remain fresh even after repeated readings.</p>
<p>For example, anyone may read Bhagavad-gita or the Srimad-Bhagavatam repeatedly throughout his whole life and yet find in them new light of information.</p>
<p>Mundane news is static whereas transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the spirit is dynamic and matter is static.</p>
<p>Those who have developed a taste for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of hearing such narrations.</p>
<p>One is quickly satiated by mundane activities, but no one is satiated by transcendental or devotional activities.</p>
<p>Uttama-sloka indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience.</p>
<p>Mundane literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental literature is quite different.</p>
<p>Transcendental literature is above the mode of darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with progressive reading and realization of the transcendental subject matter.</p>
<p>The so-called liberated persons are never satisfied by the repetition of the words aham brahmasmi.</p>
<p>Such artificial realization of Brahman becomes hackneyed, and so to relish real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Those who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy.</p>
<p>This means the Mayavada philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam is transcendental.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, along with Balarama, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to Sri Krsna, or the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The theory that a man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very much rampant nowadays, especially in India.</p>
<p>Since Lord Rama, Lord Krsna and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Personality of Godhead as indicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations.</p>
<p>This process of concocting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal.</p>
<p>Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display some feat of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of Godhead by popular vote.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna was not that type of incarnation.</p>
<p>He was actually the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appearance.</p>
<p>He appeared before His so-called mother as four-armed Visnu.</p>
<p>Then, at the request of the mother, He became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Gokula, where He was accepted as the son of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda Mata.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sri Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord Sri Krsna, was also considered a human child born of another wife of Sri Vasudeva.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that His birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of His birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>So knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord Sri Krsna is sufficient for liberation.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam, the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos, and in the Tenth Canto His specific pastimes are taken up.</p>
<p>All this becomes known as one’s reading of this literature progresses.</p>
<p>It is important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His mother, that His deeds are all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of seven), and that all these acts definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Yet, due to His mystic covering, He was always accepted as an ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other relatives.</p>
<p>Whenever some herculean task was performed by Him, the father and mother took it otherwise.</p>
<p>And they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son.</p>
<p>As such, the sages of Naimisaranya describe Him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually He is the supreme almighty Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>kalim—the age of Kali (iron age of quarrel); agatam—having arrived; ajnaya—knowing this; ksetre—in this tract of land; asmin—in this; vaisnave—specially meant for the devotee of the Lord; vayam—we; asinah—seated; dirgha—prolonged; satrena—for performance of sacrifices; kathayam—in the words of; sa-ksanah—with time at our disposal; hareh—of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Knowing well that the age of Kali has already begun, we are assembled here in this holy place to hear at great length the transcendental message of Godhead and in this way perform sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This age of Kali is not at all suitable for self-realization as was Satya-yuga, the golden age, or Treta- or Dvapara-yugas, the silver and copper ages.</p>
<p>For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime of a hundred thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation.</p>
<p>And in Treta-yuga, when the duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization was attained by performance of great sacrifice.</p>
<p>And in the Dvapara-yuga, when the duration of life was one thousand years, self-realization was attained by worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life being one hundred years only and that combined with various difficulties, the recommended process of self-realization is that of hearing and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p>The sages of Naimisaranya began this process in a place meant specifically for the devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>They prepared themselves to hear the pastimes of the Lord over a period of one thousand years.</p>
<p>By the example of these sages one should learn that regular hearing and recitation of the Bhagavatam is the only way for self-realization.</p>
<p>Other attempts are simply a waste of time, for they do not give any tangible results.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu preached this system of Bhagavata-dharma, and He recommended that all those who were born in India should take the responsibility of broadcasting the messages of Lord Sri Krsna, primarily the message of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>And when one is well established in the teachings of Bhagavad-gita, he can take up the study of Srimad-Bhagavatam for further enlightenment in self-realization.</p>

<p>We think that we have met Your Goodness by the will of providence, just so that we may accept you as captain of the ship for those who desire to cross the difficult ocean of Kali, which deteriorates all the good qualities of a human being.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The age of Kali is very dangerous for the human being.</p>
<p>Human life is simply meant for self-realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life.</p>
<p>In this age, the life span will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>People will gradually lose their memory, finer sentiments, strength, and better qualities.</p>
<p>A list of the anomalies for this age is given in the Twelfth Canto of this work.</p>
<p>And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization.</p>
<p>The people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization.</p>
<p>Out of madness they frankly say that there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization.</p>
<p>The whole system of education is geared to sense gratification, and if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education.</p>
<p>Learned men, therefore, must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of the sages of Naimisaranya and accept Sri Suta Gosvami or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship.</p>
<p>The ship is the message of Lord Sri Krsna in the shape of Bhagavad-gita or the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>

<p>Since Sri Krsna, the Absolute Truth, the master of all mystic powers, has departed for His own abode, please tell us to whom the religious principles have now gone for shelter.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Essentially religion is the prescribed codes enunciated by the Personality of Godhead Himself.</p>
<p>Whenever there is gross misuse or neglect of the principles of religion, the Supreme Lord appears Himself to restore religious principles.</p>
<p>This is stated in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Here the sages of Naimisaranya are inquiring about these principles.</p>
<p>The reply to this question is given later.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental sound representation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus it is the full representation of transcendental knowledge and religious principles.</p>
