<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sage Saunaka said:</p>
<p>The womb of Uttara, mother of Maharaja Pariksit, was spoiled by the dreadful and invincible brahmastra weapon released by Asvatthama.</p>
<p>But Maharaja Pariksit was saved by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The sages assembled in the forest of Naimisaranya inquired from Suta Gosvami about the birth of Maharaja Pariksit, but in the course of the narration other topics like the release of the brahmastra by the son of Drona, his punishment by Arjuna, Queen Kuntidevi’s prayers, the Pandavas’ visit to the place where Bhismadeva was lying, his prayers and thereafter the Lord’s departure for Dvaraka were discussed.</p>
<p>His arrival at Dvaraka and residing with the sixteen thousand queens, etc., were narrated.</p>
<p>The sages were absorbed in hearing such descriptions, but now they wanted to turn to the original topic, and thus the inquiry was made by Saunaka Rsi.</p>
<p>So the subject of the release of the brahmastra weapon by Asvatthama is renewed.</p>
